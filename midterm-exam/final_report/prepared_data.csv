1,Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellulose and its use as catalyst support for ethanol conversion to ethylene,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellulose (BC-AC) was modified with various amounts of H3PO4(x wt% P/BC-AC) and used as a catalyst for the selective dehydration of ethanol to ethylene. The BC-AC obtained at a carbonization temperature of 500 °C had a mesoporous structure with surface area and total pore volume of ~1730 m2/g and 1.0 cm3/g, respectively. An increase in the H3PO4 loading from 5% to 40% increased the number of weak acid sites on the catalyst surface, which consequently enhanced ethanol conversion. At the reaction temperature of 400 °C, the modified BC-AC with 30-40 wt% H3PO4 loading (P/BC-AC) gave an ethanol conversion at 100% and an ethylene selectivity of 100%. A high selectivity for diethyl ether (DEE) at ~ 67% at ethanol conversion of ~ 50% was obtained at 200 °C. Stability tests with a time-on-stream of 12 h, at reaction temperatures of 200 and 400 °C, showed that the P/BC-AC catalyst had high thermal stability and stable catalytic activity. Therefore, P/BC-AC was found to be very effective as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalyst for ethylene production via ethanol dehydration.","['CHE', 'MATENG']",activate carbon derive from bacterial cellulose and its use as catalyst support for ethanol conversion to ethylene elsevi b v activate carbon derive from bacterial cellulose bc ac be modify with various amount of h po x wt p bc ac and use as a catalyst for the selective dehydration of ethanol to ethylene the bc ac obtain at a carbonization temperature of c have a mesoporous structure with surface area and total pore volume of m g and cm g respectively an increase in the h po loading from to increase the number of weak acid site on the catalyst surface which consequently enhance ethanol conversion at the reaction temperature of c the modified bc ac with wt h po loading p bc ac give an ethanol conversion at and an ethylene selectivity of a high selectivity for diethyl ether dee at at ethanol conversion of be obtain at c stability test with a time on stream of h at reaction temperature of and c show that the p bc ac catalyst have high thermal stability and stable catalytic activity therefore p bc ac be find to be very effective as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalyst for ethylene production via ethanol dehydration

3,Alternative Redundant Residue Number System Construction with Redundant Residue Representations,"© 2018 IEEE.Residue number system (RNS) is a number representation system that represents a large integer with several smaller integers. Due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel, RNS is widely used in signal processing, communication, and cryptography. To extend the ability of RNS, redundant residue number system (RRNS), which has abilities to detect and correct errors, is proposed to be used in fault tolerant applications. Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations. However, it would have more costs to perform addition and multiplication on our RRNS. We also compare our work to the two previous works, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Further investigations are required to improve the performance of the proposed RRNS.",['EE'],alternative redundant residue number system construction with redundant residue representation ieee residue number system rn be a number representation system that represent a large integer with several small integer due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel rn be widely use in signal processing communication and cryptography to extend the ability of rn redundant residue number system rrn which have ability to detect and correct error be propose to be use in fault tolerant application currently there be two major way to construct rrn from rn this paper propose an alternative way to do the construction by use redundant residue representation our propose rrn can perform certain operation more efficiently for example backward conversion and error detection and can also perform a complex rn operation namely compare the value between two rrn representation however it would have more cost to perform addition and multiplication on our rrn we also compare our work to the two previous work and discuss their advantage and drawback further investigation be require to improve the performance of the propose rrn
4,Comparative study of wax inhibitor performance for pour-point reduction of oil from Sirikit Oilfield in Thailand,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In petroleum industries, waxy crude oil is normally found in petroleum production. Wax formation and precipitation during pipeline transport of waxy crude oils can cause several challenges, including wax deposition and flow reduction which adversely impacts pipeline performance in oil and gas production. To overcome the wax deposition problem, the small amount of chemicals like wax inhibitors can provide an effective preventative measure. One of this mechanism is to reduce the pour point temperature. In this work, oil from Sirikit Oilfield in Thailand is selected for this study. The wax inhibitors are selected and studied the performance for pour-point reduction. These chemicals are Polyalkyl methacrylate (PAMA), Poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecane) (PMAO), Polyalkyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol (PAMAEG) and Copolymers of maleic anhydride (CPMA) with the concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm. Also, n-pentane with the concentration of 5-20 % by weight is used as a solvent for wax inhibitors. The results from this study show that n-pentane can reduce the pour point to 39.41 % compared to the original oil. Furthermore, among the polymer group, PMAO can reduce the lowest pour point to 52.82 %. In addition, the mixed solvents of polymer with n-pentane can provide relatively less effect on pour-point reduction. The mixture of n-pentane with PMAO can lower the pour point to a certain level of 54.96 % compared to the original oil. This study can be applied to use in the real field to prevent wax deposition in the pipeline transportation for oil production.","['PE', 'ME', 'CHE']",comparative study of wax inhibitor performance for pour point reduction of oil from sirikit oilfield in thailand publish under licence by iop publish ltd in petroleum industry waxy crude oil be normally find in petroleum production wax formation and precipitation during pipeline transport of waxy crude oil can cause several challenge include wax deposition and flow reduction which adversely impact pipeline performance in oil and gas production to overcome the wax deposition problem the small amount of chemical like wax inhibitor can provide an effective preventative measure one of this mechanism be to reduce the pour point temperature in this work oil from sirikit oilfield in thailand be select for this study the wax inhibitor be select and study the performance for pour point reduction these chemical be polyalkyl methacrylate pama poly maleic anhydride alt octadecane pmao polyalkyl methacrylate co ethylene glycol pamaeg and copolymer of maleic anhydride cpma with the concentration range from to ppm also n pentane with the concentration of by weight be use as a solvent for wax inhibitor the result from this study show that n pentane can reduce the pour point to compare to the original oil furthermore among the polymer group pmao can reduce the low pour point to in addition the mixed solvent of polymer with n pentane can provide relatively less effect on pour point reduction the mixture of n pentane with pmao can lower the pour point to a certain level of compare to the original oil this study can be apply to use in the real field to prevent wax deposition in the pipeline transportation for oil production
5,Undrained lower bound solutions for end bearing capacity of shallow circular piles in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clays,"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The undrained bearing capacity of shallow circular piles in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clay is investigated by the lower bound (LB) finite element limit analysis (FELA) under two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric condition using second-order cone programming, and the new solution of the problem is presented. Modified from the isotropic von Mises yield criterion, a cross-anisotropic undrained strength criterion of clays under the axisymmetric state of stress requiring three input shear strengths in triaxial compression, direct simple shear, and triaxial extension is employed in the 2D axisymmetric LB FELA. Parametric studies on the effects of pile embedment ratio, dimensionless strength gradient, anisotropic strength ratio, and pile roughness are investigated extensively, while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with these parameters are discussed and compared. Numerical results of undrained end bearing capacity of shallow circular piles are summarized in the form of design tables that are useful for design practice and represent a new contribution to the field of pile capacity considering the combined effects of undrained strength non-homogeneity and anisotropy.","['CE', 'MATSCI']",undraine low bind solution for end bear capacity of shallow circular pile in non homogeneous and anisotropic clay john wiley sons ltd the undrained bearing capacity of shallow circular pile in non homogeneous and anisotropic clay be investigate by the lower bind lb finite element limit analysis fela under two dimensional d axisymmetric condition use second order cone programming and the new solution of the problem be present modify from the isotropic von mise yield criterion a cross anisotropic undrained strength criterion of clay under the axisymmetric state of stress require three input shear strength in triaxial compression direct simple shear and triaxial extension be employ in the d axisymmetric lb fela parametric study on the effect of pile embedment ratio dimensionless strength gradient anisotropic strength ratio and pile roughness be investigate extensively while the predict failure mechanism associate with these parameter be discuss and compare numerical result of undrained end bear capacity of shallow circular pile be summarize in the form of design table that be useful for design practice and represent a new contribution to the field of pile capacity consider the combine effect of undrained strength non homogeneity and anisotropy

7,Transformation of time Petri net into Promela,"© 2017 IEEE.This paper proposes a method of transformation of time Petri net into Promela in order to verify their behavioral properties of the timed systems. The concurrent systems, with time attributes on transactions, are typically written in time Petri net. For quantitative and qualitative analysis of their properties, these time Petri net would be transformed into Promela beforehand. We also propose the linear temporal formula to specify the correctness properties. The proposed transforming method copes with the representation of both Petri net structure and its dynamic behavior. The token flows in time Petri net are modelled into Promela code, hence the implicit dynamic behavior would be practically described in the model. The resulting Promela code is simulated and verified by SPIN tool and reveals that not only the time related behaviors would be evaluated, but also the qualitative properties, such as safety and liveness.","['CPE', 'MATH']",transformation of time petri net into promela ieee this paper propose a method of transformation of time petri net into promela in order to verify their behavioral property of the time system the concurrent system with time attribute on transaction be typically write in time petri net for quantitative and qualitative analysis of their property these time petri net would be transform into promela beforehand we also propose the linear temporal formula to specify the correctness property the propose transforming method cope with the representation of both petri net structure and its dynamic behavior the token flow in time petri net be model into promela code hence the implicit dynamic behavior would be practically describe in the model the result promela code be simulate and verify by spin tool and reveal that not only the time relate behavior would be evaluate but also the qualitative property such as safety and liveness
8,Annual Degradation Rate Analysis of Mono-Si Photovoltaics Systems in Thailand Using the Mixed Effects Method,"© 2013 IEEE.The annual degradation rate (DR) of photovoltaics (PV) system is a critical factor to evaluate the energy performance and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) during its operation lifetime. However, the DR of a particular system strongly depends on the technical configuration such as PV module and array, inverter configuration, and also the climatic conditions. Therefore, a real operation dataset of DR is necessary to PV engineer in order to estimate energy performance and the LCOE for a particular system. This article presents the annual DR for a group of PV systems in Bangkok, Thailand which share the same monocrystalline silicon (Mono-Si) solar cell and inverter brand, over a four-year period. Instead of using simple linear regression, we apply the linear mixed effects method to estimate the DR value, which is suitable to formula a time-series data. The annual DR was found about 2.7% per year, with the 95% confidence interval from 0.7% to 4.6% per year. Hence, the operation lifetime of PV system until it reaches 80% of their initial energy conversion performance is about 7 years, with the 95% confidence interval from 4 years to 28 years. The resulting DR is informative and useful for further study on PV system performance and cost of investment in tropical region. Furthermore, we are the first group in Thailand to estimate the DR of PV station at system scale based on the mixed effects method. Finally, our study has enriched the knowledge about the operation of Mono-Si PV station in real operation condition.","['PE', 'EE', 'CHE']",annual degradation rate analysis of mono si photovoltaic system in thailand use the mixed effect method ieee the annual degradation rate dr of photovoltaic pv system be a critical factor to evaluate the energy performance and the levelize cost of electricity lcoe during its operation lifetime however the dr of a particular system strongly depend on the technical configuration such as pv module and array inverter configuration and also the climatic condition therefore a real operation dataset of dr be necessary to pv engineer in order to estimate energy performance and the lcoe for a particular system this article present the annual dr for a group of pv system in bangkok thailand which share the same monocrystalline silicon mono si solar cell and inverter brand over a four year period instead of use simple linear regression we apply the linear mix effect method to estimate the dr value which be suitable to formula a time series datum the annual dr be find about per year with the confidence interval from to per year hence the operation lifetime of pv system until it reach of their initial energy conversion performance be about year with the confidence interval from year to year the result dr be informative and useful for further study on pv system performance and cost of investment in tropical region furthermore we be the first group in thailand to estimate the dr of pv station at system scale base on the mixed effect method finally our study have enrich the knowledge about the operation of mono si pv station in real operation condition

10,Model-based analysis of an integrated zinc-air flow Battery/Zinc Electrolyzer System,"© 2019 Lao-atiman, Bumroongsil, Arpornwichanop, Bumroongsakulsawat, Olaru and Kheawhom.This work aims at analyzing an integrated system of a zinc-air flow battery with a zinc electrolyzer for energy storage application. For efficient utilization of inherently intermittent renewable energy sources, safe and cost-effective energy storage systems are required. A zinc-air flow battery integrated with a zinc electrolyzer shows great promise as an electricity storage system due to its high specific energy density at low cost. A mathematical model of the system was developed. The model was implemented in MATLAB and validated against experimental results. The validation of the model was verified by the agreement between the simulation and experimental polarization characteristic. The behavior and performance of the system were then examined as a function of different operating parameters: the flow rate of the electrolyte, the initial concentration of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the initial concentration of zincate ion. These parameters significantly affected the performance of the system. The influence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the performance of the system was investigated and discussed as it significantly affected the coulombic efficiencies of both the zinc-air flow battery and the zinc electrolyzer. Optimal KOH concentration was found to be about 6-7 M. Whilst increased KOH concentration enhanced the discharge energy of the battery, it also increased HER of both the battery and the electrolyzer. However, higher initial concentration of zincate ion reduced HER and improved the coulombic efficiency of the system. Besides, a higher flow rate of electrolyte enhanced the performance of the system especially at a high charge/discharge current by maintaining the concentration of active species in the cell. Nevertheless, the battery suffered from a higher rate of HER at a high flow rate. It was noted that the model-based analysis provided better insight into the behavioral characteristics of the system leading to an improved design and operation of the integrated system of zinc-air flow battery with the zinc electrolyzer.","['PE', 'METAL', 'EE', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'IE', 'MATH']",model base analysis of an integrate zinc air flow battery zinc electrolyzer system lao atiman bumroongsil arpornwichanop bumroongsakulsawat olaru and kheawhom this work aim at analyze an integrate system of a zinc air flow battery with a zinc electrolyzer for energy storage application for efficient utilization of inherently intermittent renewable energy source safe and cost effective energy storage system be require a zinc air flow battery integrate with a zinc electrolyzer show great promise as an electricity storage system due to its high specific energy density at low cost a mathematical model of the system be develop the model be implement in matlab and validate against experimental result the validation of the model be verify by the agreement between the simulation and experimental polarization characteristic the behavior and performance of the system be then examine as a function of different operating parameter the flow rate of the electrolyte the initial concentration of potassium hydroxide koh and the initial concentration of zincate ion these parameter significantly affect the performance of the system the influence of the hydrogen evolution reaction she on the performance of the system be investigate and discuss as it significantly affect the coulombic efficiency of both the zinc air flow battery and the zinc electrolyzer optimal koh concentration be find to be about m whilst increase koh concentration enhance the discharge energy of the battery it also increase she of both the battery and the electrolyzer however high initial concentration of zincate ion reduce she and improve the coulombic efficiency of the system besides a high flow rate of electrolyte enhance the performance of the system especially at a high charge discharge current by maintain the concentration of active specie in the cell nevertheless the battery suffer from a high rate of she at a high flow rate it be note that the model base analysis provide well insight into the behavioral characteristic of the system lead to an improved design and operation of the integrate system of zinc air flow battery with the zinc electrolyzer
11,Investigation of infrastructure maintenance cost of intercity railway in Thailand,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Infrastructure in the rail system requires considerable investment in construction and maintenance. In many countries, railway operators have been able to share the capacity of the railroad to achieve efficient infrastructure usage. For the development of Thailand's railway network system in the future, it is possible for separating management between infrastructure and the rolling stock operations. Therefore, it is necessary to know the costs and factors that affects the cost of infrastructure, including government budget subsidies, to be the basis for track utilization charges. In this study, the costs of infrastructure construction and maintenance on 5 route sections representing different traffic characteristics were studied by using records from 5 years. It was found that the maintenance cost of the telecommunication and signalling system ranges from 1.3 to 1.7 million baht per year per station. The average annual maintenance cost of the railway track was 280,000 to 310,000 baht per track per kilometre.

14,Experiment and Simulation on Heavy Oil Production with Steam Flooding in Heterogeneous Reservoir,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Heavy oil has long been known as one of the main energy sources due to the huge amount of reserves. Heavy oil production depends on reservoir characteristics like permeability, reservoir pressure as well as oil viscosity. The difficulty to produce this oil is its high viscosity. The practical technology to produce this heavy oil is to use steam as steam-flooding method to reduce oil viscosity. However, the huge energy consumption in steam-flooding operation can impact the operating cost as well as a project life. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to measure the viscosity and correlate the results with temperature and to simulate the oil production by using STARS, a CMG program. Moreover, the effects of parameters like well distance, injection rate and permeability on the oil production are also investigated. The simulation results show that oil viscosity and permeability play significant roles in heavy oil production. Also, the higher oil recovery can be obtained by increasing the steam injection rate and shorten the well spacing. These conditions can be applied to use in the real field for heavy oil production. The major benefit of this practice is to reduce the steam consumption and fuel costs and increase more oil production thus extending the economic project life.","['ENV', 'PE', 'METAL', 'ME']",experiment and simulation on heavy oil production with steam flooding in heterogeneous reservoir publish under licence by iop publish ltd heavy oil have long be know as one of the main energy source due to the huge amount of reserve heavy oil production depend on reservoir characteristic like permeability reservoir pressure as well as oil viscosity the difficulty to produce this oil be its high viscosity the practical technology to produce this heavy oil be to use steam as steam flooding method to reduce oil viscosity however the huge energy consumption in steam flooding operation can impact the operating cost as well as a project life therefore the objective of this study be to measure the viscosity and correlate the result with temperature and to simulate the oil production by use star a cmg program moreover the effect of parameter like well distance injection rate and permeability on the oil production be also investigate the simulation result show that oil viscosity and permeability play significant role in heavy oil production also the high oil recovery can be obtain by increase the steam injection rate and shorten the well space these condition can be apply to use in the real field for heavy oil production the major benefit of this practice be to reduce the steam consumption and fuel cost and increase more oil production thus extend the economic project life
15,Rechargeable zinc-ion battery based on choline chloride-urea deep eutectic solvent,"© The Author(s) 2019.Recently, because of their cost effectiveness, high safety and environmental friendliness, zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are receiving enormous attention. Until now, aqueous-based ZIBs have been the focus of attention. However, the issues regarding hydrogen evolution, and zinc electrode passivation as well as dendrite formation limit their practical application. In this work, a biocompatible, stable and low-cost choline chloride/ urea (ChCl/urea) deep eutectic solvent is reported as an alternative electrolyte for rechargeable ZIBs based on delta-type manganese oxide (δ-MnO2) intercalation electrode. The behavior of the zinc electrode on stripping and deposition in ChCl/urea electrolyte was examined. Besides, the charge storage and charge-transfer characteristics of the battery was studied. The results showed that there was no sign of dendrite formation on the zinc electrode during long-term cycling. Consequently, the fabricated battery exhibited good electrochemical performance with the maximum specific capacity of 170 mAh/g and good cyclability. In addition, the system showed reversible plating/stripping of zinc (Zn) without dendrite formation and no passivation layer on the zinc electrode. Hence, the results confirmed the reversible intercalation of Zn from the deep eutectic solvent ChCl/urea into the δ-MnO2 electrode. Overall, the proposed electrolyte shows good promise for Zn/δ-MnO2 battery system.","['BME', 'METAL', 'EE', 'CHE', 'IE']",rechargeable zinc ion battery base on choline chloride urea deep eutectic solvent the author s recently because of their cost effectiveness high safety and environmental friendliness zinc ion battery zib be receive enormous attention until now aqueous base zib have be the focus of attention however the issue regard hydrogen evolution and zinc electrode passivation as well as dendrite formation limit their practical application in this work a biocompatible stable and low cost choline chloride urea chcl urea deep eutectic solvent be report as an alternative electrolyte for rechargeable zib base on delta type manganese oxide δ mno intercalation electrode the behavior of the zinc electrode on stripping and deposition in chcl urea electrolyte be examine besides the charge storage and charge transfer characteristic of the battery be study the result show that there be no sign of dendrite formation on the zinc electrode during long term cycling consequently the fabricated battery exhibit good electrochemical performance with the maximum specific capacity of mah g and good cyclability in addition the system show reversible plating stripping of zinc zn without dendrite formation and no passivation layer on the zinc electrode hence the result confirm the reversible intercalation of zn from the deep eutectic solvent chcl urea into the δ mno electrode overall the propose electrolyte show good promise for zn δ mno battery system
16,Gelation Process and Physicochemical Properties of Thai Silk Fibroin Hydrogels Induced by Various Anionic Surfactants for Controlled Release of Curcumin,"© 2019 AOCSHydrogels based on Thai silk fibroin (SF) were prepared by the induction of various anionic surfactants including sodium octyl sulfate (SOS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), which have a similar chemical structure but different alkyl chain lengths and charges. The effects of anionic surfactant types and their concentrations on the gelation mechanism and time of SF were systematically investigated. We found that SDS and STS that have long alkyl chain lengths and high negative charges could accelerate the gelation of SF to occur within 14–42 min in a concentration-dependent manner. SOS that has a short alkyl chain length and low negative charge slowly induced SF to gel at around 113–144 h. The mechanisms of SF gelation induced by these three anionic surfactants were supposed to be combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, as well as the self-transition of beta sheets. The SF + STS hydrogels were further employed to encapsulate curcumin for the controlled release application. The SF + 0.09% wt. STS hydrogel encapsulating curcumin showed a slow rate of degradation while sustained the release of curcumin. This hydrogel can be applied as a minimal invasive injectable hydrogel or as a hydrogel for topical treatment of diseases.","['BME', 'CHE']",gelation process and physicochemical property of thai silk fibroin hydrogel induce by various anionic surfactant for control release of curcumin aocshydrogel base on thai silk fibroin sf be prepare by the induction of various anionic surfactant include sodium octyl sulfate sos sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium tetradecyl sulfate st which have a similar chemical structure but different alkyl chain length and charge the effect of anionic surfactant type and their concentration on the gelation mechanism and time of sf be systematically investigate we find that sds and st that have long alkyl chain length and high negative charge could accelerate the gelation of sf to occur within min in a concentration dependent manner sos that have a short alkyl chain length and low negative charge slowly induce sf to gel at around h the mechanism of sf gelation induce by these three anionic surfactant be suppose to be combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction as well as the self transition of beta sheet the sf st hydrogel be far employ to encapsulate curcumin for the control release application the sf wt sts hydrogel encapsulating curcumin show a slow rate of degradation while sustain the release of curcumin this hydrogel can be apply as a minimal invasive injectable hydrogel or as a hydrogel for topical treatment of disease

19,Enhance Accuracy of Hierarchical Text Categorization Based on Deep Learning Network Using Embedding Strategies,"© 2018 IEEE.Hierarchical text categorization is a task that aims to assign predefined categories to text documents with hierarchical constraint. Recently, deep learning techniques has shown many success results in various fields, especially, in text categorization. In our previous work called Shared Hidden Layer Neural Network (SHL-NN), it has shown that sharing information between levels can improve a performance of the model. However, this work is based on a sequence of unsupervised word embedding vectors, so the performance should be limited. In this paper, we propose a supervised document embedding specifically designed for hierarchical text categorization based on Autoencoder, which is trained from both words and labels. To enhance the embedding vectors, the document embedding strategies are invented to utilize the class hierarchy information in the training process. To transfer the prediction result from the parent classes, the shared information technique has been improved to be more flexible and efficient. The experiment was conducted on three standard benchmarks: WIPO-C, WIPO-D and Wiki comparing to two baselines: SHL-NN and a top-down based SVM framework with TF-IDF inputs called 'HR-SVM.' The results show that the proposed model outperforms all baselines in terms of F1 macro.","['EE', 'CPE', 'EDU']",enhance accuracy of hierarchical text categorization base on deep learning network use embed strategy ieee hierarchical text categorization be a task that aim to assign predefine category to text document with hierarchical constraint recently deep learn technique have show many success result in various field especially in text categorization in our previous work call share hidden layer neural network shl nn it have show that share information between level can improve a performance of the model however this work be base on a sequence of unsupervised word embed vector so the performance should be limit in this paper we propose a supervised document embed specifically design for hierarchical text categorization base on autoencoder which be train from both word and label to enhance the embed vector the document embed strategy be invent to utilize the class hierarchy information in the training process to transfer the prediction result from the parent class the share information technique have be improve to be more flexible and efficient the experiment be conduct on three standard benchmark wipo c wipo d and wiki compare to two baseline shl nn and a top down base svm framework with tf idf input call hr svm the result show that the propose model outperform all baseline in term of f macro

22,Deep learning using risk-reward function for stock market prediction,"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Many recent studies have attempted to apply a deep learning approach to build a model for stock market prediction. Most of these studies have concentrated on using prediction accuracy as a performance metric. Some of them have also performed trading simulations to evaluate financial performance. However, financial performance was not improved significantly because the loss function used in the training process focused primarily on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction. A new loss function was developed by adding a risk-reward function, which is derived by the trading simulation results. A new scoring metric called Sharpe-F1 score, which is a combination of Sharpe ratio and F1 score is used for model selection. We employ the best prediction model from our previous work, which consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) architectures and takes event embedding vectors, historical prices and a set of technical indicators as inputs. The robustness of our framework is evaluated on two datasets by varying the key parameters used in the proposed framework. The results show that financial performance can be improved by adding a risk-reward function into the loss function used in the training process.","['BME', 'EE', 'CPE']",deep learning use risk reward function for stock market prediction association for compute machinery many recent study have attempt to apply a deep learning approach to build a model for stock market prediction most of these study have concentrate on use prediction accuracy as a performance metric some of they have also perform trading simulation to evaluate financial performance however financial performance be not improve significantly because the loss function use in the training process focus primarily on prediction accuracy in this paper we propose a new framework to train a deep neural network for stock market prediction a new loss function be develop by add a risk reward function which be derive by the trading simulation result a new scoring metric call sharpe f score which be a combination of sharpe ratio and f score be use for model selection we employ the good prediction model from our previous work which consist of convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory network lstm architecture and take event embed vector historical price and a set of technical indicator as input the robustness of our framework be evaluate on two dataset by vary the key parameter use in the propose framework the result show that financial performance can be improve by add a risk reward function into the loss function use in the training process

24,Techno-economic analysis of hydrogen production from dehydrogenation and steam reforming of ethanol for carbon dioxide conversion to methanol,"© 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDecreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by converting to higher-valued product has become of interest. Hydrogen (H2) is an important feedstock required in thermochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals such as methanol. The cost and availability of H2 affect the cost of CO2 conversion. This study is focused on the process simulation of H2 production from ethanol feedstock. Steam reforming of ethanol is compared with dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 with valued products including ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde. Form this study, steam reforming of ethanol presents the lowest cost of H2 production at 1.58 USD/kg H2 while dehydrogenation of ethanol presents the cost at 3.24 and 1.97 USD/kg H2, respectively. Although presenting the lowest cost, steam reforming of ethanol provides a net positive CO2 emission in the overall CO2 conversion to methanol process. In contrast, ethanol dehydrogenation to H2 and byproducts, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde, promotes a net negative CO2 emission of −819.20 kg/ton methanol and −5.42 kg/ton methanol, respectively. The results present a decreasing CO2 emission with an increasing cost of H2 production.","['PE', 'CHE', 'IE']",techno economic analysis of hydrogen production from dehydrogenation and steam reforming of ethanol for carbon dioxide conversion to methanol hydrogen energy publication llcdecrease carbon dioxide co emission by convert to high value product have become of interest hydrogen h be an important feedstock require in thermochemical conversion of co to chemical such as methanol the cost and availability of h affect the cost of co conversion this study be focus on the process simulation of h production from ethanol feedstock steam reforming of ethanol be compare with dehydrogenation of ethanol to h with value product include ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde form this study steam reforming of ethanol present the low cost of h production at usd kg h while dehydrogenation of ethanol present the cost at and usd kg h respectively although present the low cost steam reforming of ethanol provide a net positive co emission in the overall co conversion to methanol process in contrast ethanol dehydrogenation to h and byproducts ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde promote a net negative co emission of kg ton methanol and kg ton methanol respectively the result present a decrease co emission with an increase cost of h production
25,"Scenarios of municipal solid waste management for mitigating greenhouse gas emission: A case study of supermarket in Bangkok, Thailand","© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.As a consequence of rapid urbanization and population growth, many cities have faces issues of waste management. Landfill approach is generally decided for handling most of municipal solid waste, resulting the impacts of environment especially land occupation and global warming. As commercial building plays an importance role not only for economic value but also for environmental aspects, a supermarket located in community mall was selected as a case study towards sustainable cities. This study was aimed to investigate the current MSW management system of supermarket in order to quantify its environmental performance and to propose suitable options for improving municipal solid waste management. The findings revealed that at the business-Asusual, 397 tCO2e was emitted annually from landfilling waste of a supermarket in Thailand. However, if waste management has improved by recycling plus bio-gasification approach, not only 374 tCO2e/year will not be emitted from landfilling, but 243 tCO2e/year also be reduced due to the activities in relevant to recycling and bio-gasification process. Moreover, applying such approach provides benefit in economic term about 18,321 USD a year.

27,Improvement of Relative Permeability and Wetting Condition of Sandstone by Low Salinity Waterflooding,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Waterflooding is generally performed to maintain reservoir pressure and as a consequence, production period is extended. However, conventional waterflooding may be not suitable for every reservoir. Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSW) which is recently the most mentioned technique is therefore, considered. Although clear explanation of oil recovery mechanism is not available, it is believed that the key mechanism is Multi-component Ion Exchange (MIE). This study aims to assess improvement of relative permeability and wetting condition of sandstone formation from oilfield in Thailand, through the MIE mechanism. The study is divided into two major parts. The first part is laboratory study including core and fluid preparations, imbibition test, coreflooding test and ion-exchange detection. After laboratory data including fluid production rate and pressure difference versus time are obtained, core simulation using reservoir simulation program called STAR® commercialized by Computer Modelling Group (CMG) is performed to study the change of wetting condition through the shifting of relative permeability. Obtaining results would help verifying suitability of the implementation of this technique in oilfield. Results from imbibition test showed that LSW yields higher oil recovery factor compared to formation water. Diluted formation water at 5,000 ppm which is approximately one-third of formation water, is the best water formulation, yielding the fastest rate of imbibition in this study. From ion-exchange detection test, results showed the variation of divalent ion concentrations compared to injected water and moreover, presence of calcium and magnesium ions in oil phase supports the occurrence of MIE during the displacement mechanism. The theoretical model matching with physical data using reservoir simulation program indicates that LSW slightly affects the original wetting condition. Water wetness is lessened as can be observed from the increment of relative permeability to water at the end point saturation. Moreover, LSW reduces residual oil saturation and at the same time, increases relative permeability to oil. From the detection of MIE together with the observation of wetting condition through core simulation, it can be concluded that LSW is a promising technique for oilfield in Thailand. As produced water must be reinjected back into reservoir based on zero discharge regulation of Thai government, this low-cost technique of diluting water salinity prior to reinjection would fulfil the requirement of government and at the same time helps increasing oil recovery of the total field.","['PE', 'METAL', 'CHE']",improvement of relative permeability and wet condition of sandstone by low salinity waterflooding publish under licence by iop publish ltd waterflooding be generally perform to maintain reservoir pressure and as a consequence production period be extend however conventional waterflooding may be not suitable for every reservoir low salinity waterfloode lsw which be recently the most mention technique be therefore consider although clear explanation of oil recovery mechanism be not available it be believe that the key mechanism be multi component ion exchange mie this study aim to assess improvement of relative permeability and wet condition of sandstone formation from oilfield in thailand through the mie mechanism the study be divide into two major part the first part be laboratory study include core and fluid preparation imbibition test coreflooding test and ion exchange detection after laboratory datum include fluid production rate and pressure difference versus time be obtain core simulation use reservoir simulation program call star commercialize by computer modelling group cmg be perform to study the change of wet condition through the shifting of relative permeability obtain result would help verify suitability of the implementation of this technique in oilfield result from imbibition test show that lsw yield high oil recovery factor compare to formation water dilute formation water at ppm which be approximately one third of formation water be the good water formulation yield the fast rate of imbibition in this study from ion exchange detection test result show the variation of divalent ion concentration compare to inject water and moreover presence of calcium and magnesium ion in oil phase support the occurrence of mie during the displacement mechanism the theoretical model match with physical datum use reservoir simulation program indicate that lsw slightly affect the original wet condition water wetness be lessen as can be observe from the increment of relative permeability to water at the end point saturation moreover lsw reduce residual oil saturation and at the same time increase relative permeability to oil from the detection of mie together with the observation of wet condition through core simulation it can be conclude that lsw be a promising technique for oilfield in thailand as produce water must be reinjecte back into reservoir base on zero discharge regulation of thai government this low cost technique of dilute water salinity prior to reinjection would fulfil the requirement of government and at the same time help increase oil recovery of the total field

Dentsu's AISAS model is a model that has been proposed to describe consumer behavior. The model defines reaction when the consumer has seen advertising into five stages: attention, interest, search, action, and share. In this paper, advertisement text datasets from Facebook were labelled as the stages of AISAS model and learned to be classified by machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, like many other real-world data, our dataset had imbalanced class distribution. The classifier algorithms tend to predict mostly the majority class. To overcome this problem, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was adopted and also combined with chi-square based feature selection technique. Varieties of feature sizes based on various classifier algorithms were compared.

30,Effects of the cell and triangular microwell size on the cell-trapping efficacy and specificity,"© 2019, KSME & Springer.The single-, double- or multiple-cell entrapment efficacy is crucial in various aspects of biological studies. In this study, both computational and experimental approaches were conducted to explore the effect of the cell and microwell sizes on the ability of cell-trapping in a triangular microwell. From computational studies, it was found that the interaction between a spanwise vortex on the upper part and counter-rotating streamwise vortices at the leading edge helped to form a pair of secondary streamwise vortices deeper inside the microwell. The strength and size of these secondary streamwise vortices, which depended on the size of the microwell, played an important role in the arrangement of entrapped cells. The experimental results, with both microbeads and white blood cells (WBCs), were in good agreement with the simulated ones, and suggested that the ratio between the cell and microwell sizes was an important factor in the efficacy of single-, double- and multiple-cell cell-trapping. Entrapment of canine WBCs (size distribution between 7–15 µm) attained a highest single-cell trapping efficiency of 20.4 % in the array of 40-µm triangular microwells of 30 µm depth at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/h, but this was reduced to 16.5 and 10.6 % in the 60- and 80-µm microwells, respectively, under the same conditions.","['BME', 'ME']",effect of the cell and triangular microwell size on the cell trap efficacy and specificity ksme springer the single double or multiple cell entrapment efficacy be crucial in various aspect of biological study in this study both computational and experimental approach be conduct to explore the effect of the cell and microwell size on the ability of cell trap in a triangular microwell from computational study it be find that the interaction between a spanwise vortex on the upper part and counter rotate streamwise vortex at the lead edge help to form a pair of secondary streamwise vortice deeply inside the microwell the strength and size of these secondary streamwise vortex which depend on the size of the microwell play an important role in the arrangement of entrap cell the experimental result with both microbead and white blood cell wbc be in good agreement with the simulated one and suggest that the ratio between the cell and microwell size be an important factor in the efficacy of single double and multiple cell cell trap entrapment of canine wbcs size distribution between µm attain a high single cell trap efficiency of in the array of µm triangular microwell of µm depth at a flow rate of ml h but this be reduce to and in the and µm microwell respectively under the same condition
31,Determination of appropriate size of battery as backup system in generation system,"© 2018 IEEENowadays, power systems of many countries have high renewable energy penetration because the renewable energy has less impact on environment issues. However, because of its unpredictability and uncontrollability, it may cause the power system less reliable and need more backup power. Using only responsive conventional power plants is difficult to manage this problem. Thus, the battery energy storage that has quick response receives high interest, recently. This paper proposes a methodology to determine an appropriate size of battery as a backup system in generation system. The appropriate size of battery is determined using generation system reliability concept. Reliability indices such as API and AEI are considered. They are calculated using Monte-Carlo simulation. Finally, the Thailand Regional power system is used as a test system. Obtained results show that each region required a different size of batteries depending on an amount of renewable energy generation and load in its region.","['PE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'MATH']",determination of appropriate size of battery as backup system in generation system ieeenowaday power system of many country have high renewable energy penetration because the renewable energy have less impact on environment issue however because of its unpredictability and uncontrollability it may cause the power system less reliable and need more backup power use only responsive conventional power plant be difficult to manage this problem thus the battery energy storage that have quick response receive high interest recently this paper propose a methodology to determine an appropriate size of battery as a backup system in generation system the appropriate size of battery be determine use generation system reliability concept reliability index such as api and aei be consider they be calculate use monte carlo simulation finally the thailand regional power system be use as a test system obtain result show that each region require a different size of battery depend on an amount of renewable energy generation and load in its region
32,Comparative study of local gas-liquid hydrodynamics and mass transfer between conventional and modified airlift reactors,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Modified airlift reactor (MALR) was developed for improving the oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) by installing the slanted baffles in the riser compartment. MALR can enhance KLa value up to 97% compared to a regular reactor. However, insufficient analysis of the hydrodynamics and other oxygen transfer parameters of this new reactor has been performed to date. Therefore, this paper aims to analyse local gas-liquid dynamics and evaluate the oxygen transfer performance in MALR compared to regular reactors using clean water as a liquid phase. Air bubble distribution was employed in terms of bubble diameter, rising velocity, and interfacial area. Slanted baffles maintained the bubble size between 3.88 and 4.63 mm for the studied superficial gas velocity (Ug), which is smaller than that in airlift reactor (ALR) by approximately 0.2 mm. Bubble rising velocity (UB) is relatively increased with Ug, regardless of reactor classes. New reactor could extend the bubble residence in the water by lengthening the bubble stream path of the slanted baffles leading to decrease UB values about 39% and 52% compared to bubble column reactor (BCR) and ALR, respectively. These performances consequently resulted in an interfacial area almost two times higher than in regular reactors. Oxygen transfer improved in MALR with an extra amount of oxygen transfer efficiency of 1.57% and 0.63% over BCR and ALR, respectively.

Obtained QDs have rectangular-based shape and mainly locate near GaAs antiphase domain boundaries (APBs), which are formed during the growth of GaAs on (001) Ge substrate. The morphology and structural properties of InSb QDs can be varied by the change of controlled growth conditions. Optical phonons scatterings of the embedded InSb QDs are revealed by Raman spectroscopy. The low-temperature PL emission energy of InSb/GaAs QDs is in the range of 1.18–1.29 eV. The power-dependent PL spectroscopy confirms the type-II band alignment in this system. The thermal activation energies (22.7 meV and 146.5 meV) are extracted from the temperature-dependent PL spectroscopy (10–140 K).

37,Dynamic programming approach to optimal maintenance scheduling of substation equipment considering life cycle cost and reliability,"© 2018 IEEEAsset management of transmission system is an essential issue for smart grid and condition monitoring system, especially maintenance planning. Maintenance scheduling is the most important part of asset management. The scheduling affects the reliability of equipment, the reliability of substation system and life cycle cost (LCC). Since the equipment in substation hardly fails to operate, the information about failure is not yet systematically recorded. This paper focuses on long term maintenance based on available data of historical planning and operation data. In particular, the Weibull distribution model is used to estimate reliability function of equipment. A maintenance planning may lead to different final condition of effective age of equipment. We propose the optimal maintenance planning in conjunction with the specified final condition of equipment and compare the LCC and reliability. By using dynamic programming (DP), the algorithm gives the minimum LCC while satisfying reliability and final condition. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DP approach. Comparing with the results using the genetic algorithm, the DP method provides the maintenance planning with less LCC.","['IE', 'MATH']",dynamic programming approach to optimal maintenance scheduling of substation equipment consider life cycle cost and reliability ieeeasset management of transmission system be an essential issue for smart grid and condition monitoring system especially maintenance planning maintenance scheduling be the most important part of asset management the scheduling affect the reliability of equipment the reliability of substation system and life cycle cost lcc since the equipment in substation hardly fail to operate the information about failure be not yet systematically record this paper focus on long term maintenance base on available datum of historical planning and operation datum in particular the weibull distribution model be use to estimate reliability function of equipment a maintenance planning may lead to different final condition of effective age of equipment we propose the optimal maintenance planning in conjunction with the specify final condition of equipment and compare the lcc and reliability by use dynamic programming dp the algorithm give the minimum lcc while satisfy reliability and final condition numerical result demonstrate the effectiveness of the dp approach compare with the result use the genetic algorithm the dp method provide the maintenance planning with less lcc
38,The efficient conversion of D-Fructose to 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural using organic acids as catalytic promoters,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the main chemical building blocks to generate other high value-added biofuels and biochemicals. This study aimed to produce HMF from fructose dehydration under a biphasic system using various organic acids as catalytic promoters, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, and levulinic acid. Among these organic acids, the acetic acid was found to be the best promoter in this system. The experimental results showed a prominent correlation between the HMF formation and the pKa – the higher pKa gave rise to greater HMF yield and lower activity toward side reactions. Response surface methodology was performed to identify the optimum reaction temperature, time, and promoter concentration for fructose dehydration. Among the three variables, the reaction temperature played the most significant role in fructose conversion and HMF yield. The optimum condition to achieve the highest HMF yield at 72.5% from fructose dehydration was found at 195.8 °C under a mild concentration of acetic acid at 0.075 M for 3.2 min.

39,Biomass gasification integrated with CO2 capture processes for high-purity hydrogen production: Process performance and energy analysis,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe performance of an integrated biomass gasification and CO2 capture process to produce H2-rich gas satisfying a PEMFC specification is investigated. Wood residue and CaO are used as a biomass feedstock and a CO2 sorbent, respectively. Modeling of such an integrated process is performed by using ASPEN Plus. The effect of change in major parameters, i.e., gasifying temperature, carbonation temperature and CaO/C ratio, on the product gas composition is investigated. The H2 concentration of the product gas leaving the gasifier is found to increase as the gasifying temperature increases and reaches its maximum value when the gasifying temperature is higher than 700 °C. For the integrated process, the H2 concentration significantly decreases as the carbonation temperature increases to higher than 500 °C. Moreover, the result indicates that the CaO/C ratio should be maintained at a value higher than 3.17 to ensure that the generated CO2 is completely captured. The energetic and exergetic performances, as well as the environmental impact of the integrated process at various amounts of recycled CO2, are also investigated. The energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency based on H2 production increase as the CO2/C ratio increases, whereas the CO2 emission shows the opposite trend. The maximum exergy efficiency of 69.65%, based on the hydrogen production and the heat generation, is achieved at CO2/C and CaO/C ratios of 0.6 and 4.48, respectively. At this condition, a specific emission of CO2 of 4.4 g CO2 - eqMJ- 1 and an energy conversion efficiency of 88.09% are achieved.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'CHE']",biomass gasification integrate with co capture process for high purity hydrogen production process performance and energy analysis elsevi ltdthe performance of an integrate biomass gasification and co capture process to produce h rich gas satisfy a pemfc specification be investigate wood residue and cao be use as a biomass feedstock and a co sorbent respectively model of such an integrate process be perform by use aspen plus the effect of change in major parameter I e gasify temperature carbonation temperature and cao c ratio on the product gas composition be investigate the h concentration of the product gas leave the gasifi be find to increase as the gasifying temperature increase and reach its maximum value when the gasifying temperature be high than c for the integrate process the h concentration significantly decrease as the carbonation temperature increase to high than c moreover the result indicate that the cao c ratio should be maintain at a value high than to ensure that the generate co be completely capture the energetic and exergetic performance as well as the environmental impact of the integrate process at various amount of recycle co be also investigate the energy conversion efficiency and the exergy efficiency base on h production increase as the co c ratio increase whereas the co emission show the opposite trend the maximum exergy efficiency of base on the hydrogen production and the heat generation be achieve at co c and cao c ratio of and respectively at this condition a specific emission of co of g co eqmj and an energy conversion efficiency of be achieve
40,"Preferential nucleation, guiding, and blocking of self-propelled droplets by dislocations","© 2018 Author(s).Lattice-mismatched layers of GaAs/InGaAs are grown on GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy and subsequently heated in vacuum while the surface is imaged in situ using low-energy electron microscopy, in order to study (i) the nucleation of group-III droplets formed as a result of noncongruent sublimation and (ii) the dynamics of these self-propelled droplets as they navigate the surface. It is found that the interfacial misfit dislocation network not only influences the nucleation sites of droplets, but also exerts unusual steering power over their subsequent motion. Atypical droplet flow patterns including 90° and 180° turns are found. The directions of these dislocations-guided droplets are qualitatively explained in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane stress fields associated with the buried dislocations and the driving forces due to chemical potential and stress gradients typical of Marangoni flow. The findings would benefit processes and devices that employ droplets as catalysts or active structures such as droplet epitaxy of quantum nanostructures, vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires, or the fabrication of self-integrated circuits.","['ME', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",preferential nucleation guiding and blocking of self propel droplet by dislocation author s lattice mismatch layer of gaas ingaas be grow on gaas use molecular beam epitaxy and subsequently heat in vacuum while the surface be image in situ use low energy electron microscopy in order to study I the nucleation of group iii droplet form as a result of noncongruent sublimation and ii the dynamic of these self propel droplet as they navigate the surface it be find that the interfacial misfit dislocation network not only influence the nucleation site of droplet but also exert unusual steering power over their subsequent motion atypical droplet flow pattern include and turn be find the direction of these dislocation guide droplet be qualitatively explain in term of in plane and out of plane stress field associate with the bury dislocation and the drive force due to chemical potential and stress gradient typical of marangoni flow the finding would benefit process and device that employ droplet as catalyst or active structure such as droplet epitaxy of quantum nanostructure vapor liquid solid growth of nanowire or the fabrication of self integrate circuit
41,Reliability analysis of unsaturated soil slope stability under infiltration considering hydraulic and shear strength parameters,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In general, soil properties, including shear strength and hydraulic parameters, are characterised as a spatial variability. This paper aims to investigate the effect of spatial variability of the soil properties on slope stability during rainfall infiltration. The effective friction angle, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil water characteristic curve parameters of sand are simulated using random field theory. A seepage analysis is conducted using the random finite element method to obtain pore water pressure distribution. A stability analysis is performed to show the variation of safety factors and failure probability. The results show that the random field of the soil-water characteristic curve produces a significant variation of pore water pressure, while the random field of the effective friction angle is the most important parameter for probabilistic stability analysis.","['CE', 'ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'SAFETY', 'MATSCI']",reliability analysis of unsaturated soil slope stability under infiltration consider hydraulic and shear strength parameter springer verlag gmbh germany part of springer nature in general soil property include shear strength and hydraulic parameter be characterise as a spatial variability this paper aim to investigate the effect of spatial variability of the soil property on slope stability during rainfall infiltration the effective friction angle saturate hydraulic conductivity and soil water characteristic curve parameter of sand be simulate use random field theory a seepage analysis be conduct use the random finite element method to obtain pore water pressure distribution a stability analysis be perform to show the variation of safety factor and failure probability the result show that the random field of the soil water characteristic curve produce a significant variation of pore water pressure while the random field of the effective friction angle be the most important parameter for probabilistic stability analysis
42,Evaluation of Polymer Alternating Waterflooding in Multilayered Heterogeneous Waterflooded Reservoir,"© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Polymer flooding is widely implemented to improve oil recovery since polymer can increase sweep efficiency and smoothen heterogeneous reservoir profile. However, polymer solution is somewhat difficult to be injected due to high viscosity and thus, water slug is recommended to be injected before and during polymer injection in order to increase an ease of injecting this viscous fluid into the wellbore. In this study, numerical simulation is performed to determine the most appropriate operating parameters to maximize oil recovery. The results show that pre-flushed water should be injected until water breakthrough while alternating water slug size should be as low as 5% of polymer slug size. Concentration for each polymer slugs should be kept constant and recommended number of alternative cycles is 2. Combining these operating parameters altogether contributes to oil recovery of 53.69% whereas single-slug polymer flooding provides only 53.04% which is equivalent to 8,000 STB of oil gain.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME']",evaluation of polymer alternate waterflooding in multilayere heterogeneous waterflooded reservoir the author publish by edp sciences polymer flooding be widely implement to improve oil recovery since polymer can increase sweep efficiency and smoothen heterogeneous reservoir profile however polymer solution be somewhat difficult to be inject due to high viscosity and thus water slug be recommend to be inject before and during polymer injection in order to increase an ease of inject this viscous fluid into the wellbore in this study numerical simulation be perform to determine the most appropriate operate parameter to maximize oil recovery the result show that pre flushed water should be inject until water breakthrough while alternate water slug size should be as low as of polymer slug size concentration for each polymer slug should be keep constant and recommend number of alternative cycle be combine these operate parameter altogether contribute to oil recovery of whereas single slug polymer flooding provide only which be equivalent to stb of oil gain
43,Real-Time Rollover Warning in Tripped and Un-tripped Rollovers with A Neural Network,"© 2018 IEEE.Nearly 35% of passenger vehicle accident deaths are from rollover crashes. In vehicle stability control system, the active rollover prevention is presented to prevent rollovers. An imminent rollover should be detected immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention. A traditional rollover index is able to detect un-tripped rollovers. However, it fails to detect tripped rollovers from external inputs such as tripping by the force of a vehicle striking a curb or a road bump. Thus, a new neural network algorithm to detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers is needed so any estimation algorithms to determine unknown parameters will no longer be used. The neural network algorithm uses multi-variables from available sensors on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warning into 3 levels: 'Safe', 'Low Risk', and 'High Risk'. Moreover, the algorithm can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollover by testing with a 1/5th scaled vehicle. In order to show dynamic similarity between the 1/5th scale vehicle and a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham π theorem is used. From experiment results, it is clear that the neural network algorithm can be used to accurately enable the rollover warning for the tripped and un-tripped rollover.",['SAFETY'],real time rollover warn in trip and un trip rollover with a neural network ieee nearly of passenger vehicle accident death be from rollover crash in vehicle stability control system the active rollover prevention be present to prevent rollover an imminent rollover should be detect immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention a traditional rollover index be able to detect un trip rollover however it fail to detect trip rollover from external input such as trip by the force of a vehicle strike a curb or a road bump thus a new neural network algorithm to detect both trip and un trip rollover be need so any estimation algorithm to determine unknown parameter will no long be use the neural network algorithm use multi variable from available sensor on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warn into level safe low risk and high risk moreover the algorithm can detect both trip and un trip rollover by test with a th scale vehicle in order to show dynamic similarity between the th scale vehicle and a full sized vehicle the buckingham π theorem be use from experiment result it be clear that the neural network algorithm can be use to accurately enable the rollover warn for the trip and un trip rollover

We employ an approach of robust H2 hierarchical decentralized control. This approach utilizes a linear quadratic performance criterion which composes of local and global terms. Local term represents local control action of agents whereas the global term deals with cooperation among agents. We formulate design of the local and global feedback control laws as optimization over linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, the LMI formulation can incorporate a specified constraint on disturbance attenuation. Finally, a design procedure and numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust H2 design approach.","['CPE', 'MATH']",design of robust hierarchical control for homogeneous multi agent system with parametric uncertainty and exogenous disturbance jsme this paper propose robust control synthesis for homogeneous leaderless multi agent system mass subject to parametric uncertainty and exogenous disturbance we employ an approach of robust h hierarchical decentralized control this approach utilize a linear quadratic performance criterion which compose of local and global term local term represent local control action of agent whereas the global term deal with cooperation among agent we formulate design of the local and global feedback control law as optimization over linear matrix inequality lmi furthermore the lmi formulation can incorporate a specify constraint on disturbance attenuation finally a design procedure and numerical example be provide to illustrate the effectiveness of the propose robust h design approach

BC pellicle was immersed in a diluted NR latex (NRL) suspension in the presence of ethanol aqueous solution. Effects of NRL concentrations (0.5%-10% dry rubber content, DRC) and immersion temperatures (30-70 °C) on the film characteristics were studied. It was revealed that the combination of nanocellulose fibrous networks and NR polymer provided a synergistic effect on the mechanical properties of NR-BC films. In comparison with BC films, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the NR-BC films were considerably improved ~4-fold. The NR-BC films also exhibited improved water resistance over that of BC films and possessed a high resistance to non-polar solvents such as toluene. NR-BC films were biodegradable and could be degraded completely within 5-6 weeks in soil.","['CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",development and characterization of bacterial cellulose reinforce with natural rubber by the author film of bacterial cellulose bc reinforce by natural rubber nr with remarkably high mechanical strength be develop by combine the prominent mechanical property of multilayer bc nanofibrous structural network and the high elastic hydrocarbon polymer of nr bc pellicle be immerse in a diluted nr latex nrl suspension in the presence of ethanol aqueous solution effect of nrl concentration dry rubber content drc and immersion temperature c on the film characteristic be study it be reveal that the combination of nanocellulose fibrous network and nr polymer provide a synergistic effect on the mechanical property of nr bc film in comparison with bc film the tensile strength and elongation at break of the nr bc film be considerably improve fold the nr bc film also exhibit improved water resistance over that of bc film and possess a high resistance to non polar solvent such as toluene nr bc film be biodegradable and could be degrade completely within week in soil
46,Enhanced Levulinic Acid Production from Cellulose by Combined Brønsted Hydrothermal Carbon and Lewis Acid Catalysts,"© 2019 American Chemical Society. This study presents a synergistic catalytic system using the combination of Brønsted hydrothermal carbon-based acid (HTCG-SO 3 H) and Lewis acid catalysts for one-pot conversion of cellulose to levulinic acid (LA). Chromium chloride (CrCl 3 ), among a number of other Lewis acidic metal chlorides, was found to give the highest LA yields, and was therefore used in combination with the HTCG-SO 3 H, for cellulose conversion to LA. With the appropriate amount of HTCG-SO 3 H, the formation of side products could be reduced, resulting in improved selectivity of LA. Compared with that obtained by CrCl 3 alone, at 5 wt % HTCG-SO 3 H, 0.015 M CrCl 3 , 200 °C and 5 min reaction time, the LA yield was considerably enhanced from 30 wt % to 40 wt %. Since HTCG-SO 3 H is a heterogeneous catalyst that can be easily prepared from biomass at moderate temperature, its use in such combined catalyst system offers economic and environmental benefits, thus making large-scale implementation of such process potentially feasible.","['CHE', 'MATENG']",enhance levulinic acid production from cellulose by combine brønste hydrothermal carbon and lewis acid catalyst american chemical society this study present a synergistic catalytic system use the combination of brønste hydrothermal carbon base acid htcg so h and lewis acid catalyst for one pot conversion of cellulose to levulinic acid la chromium chloride crcl among a number of other lewis acidic metal chloride be find to give the high la yield and be therefore use in combination with the htcg so h for cellulose conversion to la with the appropriate amount of htcg so h the formation of side product could be reduce result in improved selectivity of la compare with that obtain by crcl alone at wt htcg so h m crcl c and min reaction time the la yield be considerably enhance from wt to wt since htcg so h be a heterogeneous catalyst that can be easily prepare from biomass at moderate temperature its use in such combined catalyst system offer economic and environmental benefit thus make large scale implementation of such process potentially feasible
47,"The production of volatile fatty acids from Napier grass via an anaerobic leach bed process: The influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition","© 2019 The Authors.The production of volatile fatty acid (VFA)-rich leachate as feedstock for methane production is an essential and rate-limiting step in two-stage grass biogasification. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of leachate dilution, inoculum, recirculation, and buffering agent addition on the acidification of Napier grass in anaerobic leach bed reactors (AnLBRs). Four AnLBRs with 14.17 L effective volume were operated at ambient temperature for 28 days in each experiment. The results clearly demonstrate the significance of the control parameters, particularly leachate dilution and inoculum, in the regulation of grass solubilization. Different dilutions of leachate produced different grass degradation rates. These different dilutions generated 95.62-112.63 g of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) or 0.52-0.62 g SCOD/g VSadded for those diluted at 1.0-7.0-day intervals compared to 51.50 g SCOD or 0.28 g SCOD/g VSadded for those without dilution. Adding inoculums of 10-30% increased the SCOD to 67.01-115.65 g SCOD or 0.40-0.59 g SCOD/g VSadded. While leachate recirculation and the addition of a buffering agent had less influence on solubilization, which increased by only 6.80-16.41% of SCOD produced. These produced leachates contained orderly acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The proposed conditions (20% of added inoculum and leachate dilution at a 3.0-day interval), yielded practical degrees of solubilization and acidification of 46.61% and 62.21%, respectively, or 0.56 g SCOD/g VSadded and 0.26 g VFA/g VSadded. These results demonstrate that beneficial control conditions can promote the rapid and practical production of VFAs from grass biomass via an AnLBR.","['CHE', 'AGRI']",the production of volatile fatty acid from napier grass via an anaerobic leach bed process the influence of leachate dilution inoculum recirculation and buffer agent addition the author the production of volatile fatty acid vfa rich leachate as feedstock for methane production be an essential and rate limit step in two stage grass biogasification batch experiment be conduct to investigate the influence of leachate dilution inoculum recirculation and buffer agent addition on the acidification of napi grass in anaerobic leach bed reactor anlbr four anlbrs with l effective volume be operate at ambient temperature for day in each experiment the result clearly demonstrate the significance of the control parameter particularly leachate dilution and inoculum in the regulation of grass solubilization different dilution of leachate produce different grass degradation rate these different dilution generate g of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod or g scod g vsadde for those dilute at day interval compare to g scod or g scod g vsadde for those without dilution add inoculum of increase the scod to g scod or g scod g vsadded while leachate recirculation and the addition of a buffering agent have less influence on solubilization which increase by only of scod produce these produce leachate contain orderly acetic propionic and butyric acid the propose condition of add inoculum and leachate dilution at a day interval yield practical degree of solubilization and acidification of and respectively or g scod g vsadded and g vfa g vsadde these result demonstrate that beneficial control condition can promote the rapid and practical production of vfas from grass biomass via an anlbr

49,Mechanisms of chloride and sulfate removal from municipal-solid-waste-incineration fly ash (MSWI FA): Effect of acid-base solutions,"© 2019A general approach to managing municipal solid waste is by incineration. Unfortunately, large amounts of municipal-solid-waste-incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) is produced in the process, with their heavy metals content posing further problems to the environment. One fundamental treatment of MSWI FA heavy metals is called solidification-stabilization, where MSWI FA is solidified in cement-based materials to cap hazardous elements from being released into the environment. Mortar formed from this cement mixed with MSWI FA suffer from decreased compressive strength due to their chloride and sulfate contents. Thus, pre-treatment of MSWI FA to remove these salts before producing mortar is desirable. This study investigated treating MSWI FA with deionized water, 0.01 M and 0.1 M nitric acid, and 0.1 M and 0.25 M sodium carbonate to remove chloride and sulfate. Physical and chemical structures of treated and untreated MSWI FA was studied to understand the chloride and sulfate removal mechanisms. Treated MSWI FA was used as cement replacement in mortar, and the compressive strength was tested.

50,Impact of Oxygen Vacancy on the Photocatalytic Selective Hydrogenation of 3-Nitrostyrene via Calcination of TiO2,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this work, P25-TiO2 was treated by calcination in air at difference temperature (600-900°C) for 5h. Treated catalysts were tested in photocatalytic selective hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene (3-NS) to 3-vinylaniline (3-VA). The properties of treated catalysts were characterized by using XRD, XPS, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. 3-vinylaniline and acetone were produced from photocatalytic (λ > 300nm) selective hydrogenation reaction of 3-nitrostyrene in 2-propanol and suspension with P25-TiO2. The Ti3+ at locate with oxygen defect, which at below conduction band were acted as active site for trapped electron to conduction band. These effects leading to excess oxygen defect caused low activity due to recombination center. An optimal calcination temperature was 700°C ascribed to the enhancement of high conversion (71%) with 100% 3-VA selectivity due to optimal oxygen vacancies.","['CHE', 'MATSCI']",impact of oxygen vacancy on the photocatalytic selective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene via calcination of tio publish under licence by iop publish ltd in this work p tio be treat by calcination in air at difference temperature c for h treat catalyst be test in photocatalytic selective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene ns to vinylaniline va the property of treat catalyst be characterize by use xrd xps and uv vis spectroscopy vinylaniline and acetone be produce from photocatalytic λ nm selective hydrogenation reaction of nitrostyrene in propanol and suspension with p tio the ti at locate with oxygen defect which at below conduction band be act as active site for trap electron to conduction band these effect lead to excess oxygen defect cause low activity due to recombination center an optimal calcination temperature be c ascribe to the enhancement of high conversion with va selectivity due to optimal oxygen vacancy
51,Disaster-Resilient Communication Framework for Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks,"© 2019 IEEE.Most of natural disaster events have caused damage to the basic infrastructure. This leads to impossibility for victims and rescuers to communicate through the Internet. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) and Moveable and Deployable Resource Unit (MDRU) are two popular solutions for recovery of the communication system. Based on the concept of wireless mesh network, the NerveNet is a disaster-resilient mesh-topology network which is strong against failures in disaster. Moreover, vehicles are considered as a key component in which MDRU can be deployed. In this paper, we propose a disaster-resilient communication framework for heterogeneous vehicular network (HetVNet). The proposed framework integrates NerveNet with the traditional network. We also show our implementation of the network switching algorithm for selecting either NerveNet or LTE for the HetVNet. The real experiments were conducted using the campus shuttle buses in Chulalongkorn University. The results show that the proposed framework can operate well in normal scenario, HetVNet scenario, and disaster scenario. Specifically, in the disaster situation where LTE network is not available, all of the data traffic is transferred via NerveNet. In the normal situation where NerveNet and LTE networks are available, the data traffic can be transferred over both of them.","['EE', 'CPE']",disaster resilient communication framework for heterogeneous vehicular network ieee most of natural disaster event have cause damage to the basic infrastructure this lead to impossibility for victim and rescuer to communicate through the internet wireless mesh network wmn and moveable and deployable resource unit mdru be two popular solution for recovery of the communication system base on the concept of wireless mesh network the nervenet be a disaster resilient mesh topology network which be strong against failure in disaster moreover vehicle be consider as a key component in which mdru can be deploy in this paper we propose a disaster resilient communication framework for heterogeneous vehicular network hetvnet the propose framework integrate nervenet with the traditional network we also show our implementation of the network switch algorithm for select either nervenet or lte for the hetvnet the real experiment be conduct use the campus shuttle bus in chulalongkorn university the result show that the propose framework can operate well in normal scenario hetvnet scenario and disaster scenario specifically in the disaster situation where lte network be not available all of the datum traffic be transfer via nervenet in the normal situation where nervenet and lte network be available the datum traffic can be transfer over both of they

The extractant of tributyl phosphate (TBP) as well as the following organic solvents i.e. cyclohexane, n-heptane, kerosene and toluene were selected for use in this work. Further, the physical properties of the mixing solutions such as viscosity, surface tension, interfacial tension and solubility with water were observed when the percent weights of the extractant increased. The principle of intermolecular attraction between the molecules in the mixing solutions was considered in order to explain the tendencies of results. Tie-line data were determined for ascertaining the solubility of extractant in the organic and aqueous phases. A thermodynamic NRTL model was also evaluated and its data compared with the experimental results. Consequently, good correlations were displayed by the root-mean square deviation (rmsd) at values about 2%. Finally, for understanding the solvation of solute and solvent, the molecular interaction behaviors of the molecules in the mixing solutions were examined by spectroscopic analyses.","['CHE', 'MATSCI']",the experimental investigation on viscosity surface tension interfacial tension and solubility of the binary and ternary system for tributyl phosphate tbp extractant in various organic solvent with water thermodynamic nrtl model and molecular interaction approach elsevi b v in order to provide a database for support stability in the separation process the physical property of the mix solution between extractant and organic solvent with without water be investigate at temperature k and pressure mpa the extractant of tributyl phosphate tbp as well as the follow organic solvent I e cyclohexane n heptane kerosene and toluene be select for use in this work far the physical property of the mix solution such as viscosity surface tension interfacial tension and solubility with water be observe when the percent weight of the extractant increase the principle of intermolecular attraction between the molecule in the mix solution be consider in order to explain the tendency of result tie line datum be determine for ascertain the solubility of extractant in the organic and aqueous phase a thermodynamic nrtl model be also evaluate and its datum compare with the experimental result consequently good correlation be display by the root mean square deviation rmsd at value about finally for understand the solvation of solute and solvent the molecular interaction behavior of the molecule in the mix solution be examine by spectroscopic analysis

54,Thai defamatory text classification on social media,"© 2018 IEEE.Development of social media has brought a huge change to social communities in several aspects. They offer a place where social media users can post information, express opinions, and share interests. However, some information and opinions may cause a negative impact on the person mentioned in the post and that person can become a target of defamation. In Thailand, although defaming someone on social media is illegal, most social media users are not aware of it. To raise awareness of this issue, this paper proposes the classification of defamatory text in Thai language. Several approaches to text classification are used to analyze textual comments to political news and articles on Facebook, including word n-grams, character ngrams, specific terms, grammatical dependency structure, and sentiment polarity. The experiment is conducted using two machine learning methods with several combination of the approaches. The result shows that SVM performed better than Naïve Bayes, and word n-grams and character n-grams are more efficient than other approaches with F score of 0.64 and accuracy of 0.74. In addition, dependency structure, specific terms, and sentiment polarity perform quite well with precision of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.66, but with lower recall rate of 0.35.

55,Multi-objective optimization of sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cell,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdBiomass is one of the encouraging renewable energy sources to mitigate uncertainties in the future energy supply and to address the climate change caused by the increased CO2 emissions. Conventionally, thermal energy is produced from biomass via combustion process with low thermodynamic efficiency. Conversely, gasification of biomass integrated with innovative power generation technologies, such as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), offers much higher conversion efficiency. Typically, energy conversion process has multiple conflicting performance criteria, such as capital and operating costs, annual profit, thermodynamic performance and environment impact. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) methods are used to found the optimal compromise in the objective function space, and also to acquire the corresponding optimal values of decision variables. This work investigates integration and optimization of a Sorption Enhanced Steam Biomass Gasification (SEG) with a SOFC and Gas Turbine (GT) system for the production of power and heat from Eucalyptus wood chips. The energy system model is firstly developed in Aspen Plus simulator, which has five main units: (1) SEG coupled with calcium looping for hydrogen-rich gas production, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC-GT for converting hydrogen into electricity, (4) catalytic burning and CO2 compression, and (5) cement production from the purge CaO stream of SEG unit. Then, the design and operating variables of the conversion system are optimized for annual profit, annualized total capital cost, operating cost and exergy efficiency, using MOO. Finally, for the implementation purpose, two selection methods and parametric uncertainty analysis are performed to identify good solutions from the Pareto-optimal front.","['CE', 'ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'EE', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'IE', 'MATH']",multi objective optimization of sorption enhance steam biomass gasification with solid oxide fuel cell elsevi ltdbiomass be one of the encouraging renewable energy source to mitigate uncertainty in the future energy supply and to address the climate change cause by the increase co emission conventionally thermal energy be produce from biomass via combustion process with low thermodynamic efficiency conversely gasification of biomass integrate with innovative power generation technology such as solid oxide fuel cell sofc offer much high conversion efficiency typically energy conversion process have multiple conflicting performance criterion such as capital and operating cost annual profit thermodynamic performance and environment impact multi objective optimization moo method be use to find the optimal compromise in the objective function space and also to acquire the corresponding optimal value of decision variable this work investigate integration and optimization of a sorption enhance steam biomass gasification seg with a sofc and gas turbine gt system for the production of power and heat from eucalyptus wood chip the energy system model be firstly develop in aspen plus simulator which have five main unit seg couple with calcium loop for hydrogen rich gas production hot gas cleaning and steam reform sofc gt for convert hydrogen into electricity catalytic burning and co compression and cement production from the purge cao stream of seg unit then the design and operating variable of the conversion system be optimize for annual profit annualize total capital cost operating cost and exergy efficiency use moo finally for the implementation purpose two selection method and parametric uncertainty analysis be perform to identify good solution from the pareto optimal front

59,"Nonlinear Analysis for Bending, Buckling and Post-buckling of Nano-Beams with Nonlocal and Surface Energy Effects","© 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.The modeling and analysis for mechanical response of nano-scale beams undergoing large displacements and rotations are presented. The beam element is modeled as a composite consisting of the bulk material and the surface material layer. Both Eringen nonlocal elasticity theory and Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory are adopted to formulate the moment-curvature relationship of the beam. In the formulation, the pre-existing residual stress within the bulk material, induced by the residual surface tension in the material layer, is also taken into account. The resulting moment-curvature relationship is then utilized together with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the elliptic integral technique to establish a set of exact algebraic equations governing the displacements and rotations at the ends of the beam. The linearized version of those equations is also established and used in the derivation of a closed-form solution of the buckling load of nano-beams under various end conditions. A discretization-free solution procedure based mainly upon Newton iterative scheme and a selected numerical quadrature is developed to solve a system of fully coupled nonlinear equations. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique yields highly accurate results comparable to the benchmark analytical solutions. In addition, the nonlocal and surface energy effects play a significant role on the predicted buckling load, post-buckling and bending responses of the nano-beam. In particular, the presence of those effects remarkably alters the overall stiffness of the beam and predicted solutions exhibit strong size-dependence when the characteristic length of the beam is comparable to the intrinsic length scale of the material surface.","['NANO', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",nonlinear analysis for bend buckling and post buckling of nano beam with nonlocal and surface energy effect world scientific publishing company the modeling and analysis for mechanical response of nano scale beam undergo large displacement and rotation be present the beam element be model as a composite consisting of the bulk material and the surface material layer both eringen nonlocal elasticity theory and gurtin murdoch surface elasticity theory be adopt to formulate the moment curvature relationship of the beam in the formulation the pre exist residual stress within the bulk material induce by the residual surface tension in the material layer be also take into account the result moment curvature relationship be then utilize together with euler bernoulli beam theory and the elliptic integral technique to establish a set of exact algebraic equation govern the displacement and rotation at the end of the beam the linearize version of those equation be also establish and use in the derivation of a closed form solution of the buckle load of nano beam under various end condition a discretization free solution procedure base mainly upon newton iterative scheme and a select numerical quadrature be develop to solve a system of fully couple nonlinear equation it be demonstrate that the propose technique yield highly accurate result comparable to the benchmark analytical solution in addition the nonlocal and surface energy effect play a significant role on the predict buckle load post buckle and bend response of the nano beam in particular the presence of those effect remarkably alter the overall stiffness of the beam and predict solution exhibit strong size dependence when the characteristic length of the beam be comparable to the intrinsic length scale of the material surface
60,Evaluation of stability and viscosity measurement of emulsion from oil from production in northern oilfield in Thailand,"© 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Emulsion is normally present in oil due to the mixing occurring during oil recovery. The formation of emulsion can cause some problems in production and transportation. Viscosity and stability of emulsion play a key roles in oil transportation and separation to meet sales specification. Therefore, the aims of this research are to measure the viscosity of oil an emulsion and to evaluate the stability of emulsion of light oil from Fang oilfield in Thailand. The parameters of this study are temperature, shear rate and water cut ranging from 50 to 80 °C, 3.75 to 70 s-1 and 0 to 60%, respectively. These effects of parameters on viscosity and stability of emulsion are required for the design of the process and to increase oil production with various conditions. The results shows that viscosity decreases as temperature and shear rate increase. In contrast, viscosity becomes higher when water cut is lower. Furthermore, droplet sizes of water-in-oil emulsion at different conditions are investigated the stability of emulsion. The droplet sizes become smaller when high shear rate is applied and emulsion becomes more stable. Furthermore, correlations are developed to predict the viscosity and stability of the oil and emulsion from Thailand.","['PE', 'ME', 'CHE']",evaluation of stability and viscosity measurement of emulsion from oil from production in northern oilfield in thailand publish under licence by iop publish ltd emulsion be normally present in oil due to the mixing occur during oil recovery the formation of emulsion can cause some problem in production and transportation viscosity and stability of emulsion play a key role in oil transportation and separation to meet sale specification therefore the aim of this research be to measure the viscosity of oil an emulsion and to evaluate the stability of emulsion of light oil from fang oilfield in thailand the parameter of this study be temperature shear rate and water cut range from to c to s and to respectively these effect of parameter on viscosity and stability of emulsion be require for the design of the process and to increase oil production with various condition the result show that viscosity decrease as temperature and shear rate increase in contrast viscosity become high when water cut be low furthermore droplet size of water in oil emulsion at different condition be investigate the stability of emulsion the droplet size become small when high shear rate be apply and emulsion become more stable furthermore correlation be develop to predict the viscosity and stability of the oil and emulsion from thailand

62,Effect of Silica and Alumina Ratio on Bed Agglomeration during Fluidized Bed Gasification of Rice Straw,"© 2018 IEEE.Bed agglomeration is one operational challenge during fluidized bed gasification when rice straw is used as raw materials. Rice straw contains high potassium and other components which may lower ash melting point causing bed agglomeration. This study focused on the effect of alumina and silica ratio of bed materials in fluidized bed gasifier. The ratio of alumina bed was 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0. The experiments were performed at 700, 800 and 900°C with equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.2. Rice straw size 425-850 μm was used as raw materials. The result showed that the high ratio of alumina deceased bed agglomeration at 700°C. However, similar alumina ratio increased bed agglomeration at 800 and 900°C. In addition, the effect of temperature on defluidization time was significant. As the operating temperature increased, the defluidization time decreased. Although the ratio of the bed material was different but the result of defluidization time show a similar trend. As a result, high operating temperature may not suitable for fluidized bed gasification with this particular biomass. The SEM/EDS analyzed showed that potassium, calcium and silicate are major element in a linkage between bed particles. As a result, 75% of alumina bed ratio at 700°C was sufficient to avoid bed agglomeration during fluidized bed gasification of rice straw. In conclusion, specific ratio of alumina and silica can prevent agglomeration in fluidized bed gasification of rice straw when operating temperature lower than apparent eutectic melting point of involved alkalis from rice straw. The result from this investigation may lead to options on mitigating the problem of bed agglomeration in fluidized bed gasifier of rice straw.","['CHE', 'MATSCI']",effect of silica and alumina ratio on bed agglomeration during fluidize bed gasification of rice straw ieee bed agglomeration be one operational challenge during fluidize bed gasification when rice straw be use as raw material rice straw contain high potassium and other component which may lower ash melting point cause bed agglomeration this study focus on the effect of alumina and silica ratio of bed material in fluidize bed gasifier the ratio of alumina bed be and the experiment be perform at and c with equivalence ratio er of rice straw size μm be use as raw material the result show that the high ratio of alumina decease bed agglomeration at c however similar alumina ratio increase bed agglomeration at and c in addition the effect of temperature on defluidization time be significant as the operating temperature increase the defluidization time decrease although the ratio of the bed material be different but the result of defluidization time show a similar trend as a result high operating temperature may not suitable for fluidize bed gasification with this particular biomass the sem eds analyze show that potassium calcium and silicate be major element in a linkage between bed particle as a result of alumina bed ratio at c be sufficient to avoid bed agglomeration during fluidize bed gasification of rice straw in conclusion specific ratio of alumina and silica can prevent agglomeration in fluidize bed gasification of rice straw when operate temperature low than apparent eutectic melting point of involved alkalis from rice straw the result from this investigation may lead to option on mitigate the problem of bed agglomeration in fluidize bed gasifi of rice straw

Published by Elsevier Ltd.An electrochemical biosensor comprising copper, nano-diamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT) has been fabricated to detect the amino acids of Parkia speciosa (PS) seeds. Parkia speciosa (stink bean), a Southeast Asian legume, is composed of medicinal chemicals which exhibit biological activities. The electro-catalytic activity of three electrodes Cu/CNT/ND, Zn/CNT/ND and NiO/CNT/ND was studied using 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 MKCl. The Zn/CNT/ND electrode exhibited irreversible reaction free oxidation with reduction peaks at -1 V, whereas, a pair redox peaks was observed for Cu/CNT/ND electrode. The immobilization of l-amino acid oxidase on the Cu/CNT/ND electrode was carried out to catalyze the amino acids detection. It was observed that the anodic and cathodic peak currents increased linearly with both the square root of the scan rate (ν1/2) and scan rate (ν) over the studied scan range of 0.01-0.1 V/s with high correlation coefficients and following both the adsorption and the diffusion-controlled mechanisms. The developed biosensor displayed a very good electro-catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the amino acid to release H2O2 and NH3 as a result of the reaction between the active sites and the Parkia speciosa component. This was also confirmed by a drop in the pH value from 6.8 to 6.5 and a change in the color of the solution from green to yellow (releasing H2S). The impedance results indicated an inductance behavior due to the co-formation of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the water via the adsorption on the electrode surface.","['BME', 'METAL', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATENG']",electrochemical investigation of amino acid parkia seed use the composite electrode base on copper carbon nanotube nanodiamond the author publish by elsevi ltd an electrochemical biosensor comprise copper nano diamond nd and carbon nanotube cnt have be fabricate to detect the amino acid of parkia speciosa ps seed parkia speciosa stink bean a southeast asian legume be compose of medicinal chemical which exhibit biological activity the electro catalytic activity of three electrode cu cnt nd zn cnt nd and nio cnt nd be study use mm potassium ferrocyanide in mkcl the zn cnt nd electrode exhibit irreversible reaction free oxidation with reduction peak at v whereas a pair redox peak be observe for cu cnt nd electrode the immobilization of l amino acid oxidase on the cu cnt nd electrode be carry out to catalyze the amino acid detection it be observe that the anodic and cathodic peak current increase linearly with both the square root of the scan rate ν and scan rate ν over the study scan range of v s with high correlation coefficient and follow both the adsorption and the diffusion control mechanism the develop biosensor display a very good electro catalytic activity toward the oxidation of the amino acid to release h o and nh as a result of the reaction between the active site and the parkia speciosa component this be also confirm by a drop in the ph value from to and a change in the color of the solution from green to yellow release h s the impedance result indicate an inductance behavior due to the co formation of the hydrogen peroxide h o and the water via the adsorption on the electrode surface

65,Oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over different VOx/SBA-15 catalysts,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.In this present study, characteristics and catalytic properties of different VOx/SBA-15 catalysts for oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde were determined and well related. First, the SBA-15 supports were synthesized using the sol-gel (SG) and hydrothermal (HT) methods with Zr and La modification. Then, VOx species (2 wt% of V) were deposited on different SBA-15 supports. Among all catalysts, the V-Zr-La/SBA-15-HT showed the highest catalytic activity having 80% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 38% at 400 °C in non-oxidative dehydrogenation, while 98% conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40% were obtained for this catalyst at lower temperature (300 °C) in oxidative dehydrogenation. In fact, two of the most powerful techniques used to elucidate the nature of VOx species dispersed on Zr-La/SBA -15 supports were X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption. It is worth noting that isolated monomeric VOx species, particularly the V4+ species, as well as the amounts of weak basic sites essentially played important role in non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde.","['CHE', 'MATENG']",oxidative and non oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over different vox sba catalyst elsevier ltd all right reserve in this present study characteristic and catalytic property of different vox sba catalyst for oxidative and non oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde be determined and well relate first the sba support be synthesize use the sol gel sg and hydrothermal ht method with zr and la modification then vox species wt of v be deposit on different sba support among all catalyst the v zr la sba ht show the high catalytic activity have conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca at c in non oxidative dehydrogenation while conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde yield of ca be obtain for this catalyst at low temperature c in oxidative dehydrogenation in fact two of the most powerful technique use to elucidate the nature of vox specie disperse on zr la sba support be x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and co temperature program desorption it be worth note that isolate monomeric vox specie particularly the v specie as well as the amount of weak basic site essentially play important role in non oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde

The biomedical article is the trendy issue at the moment leading to the huge amount of knowledge created rapidly. In this paper, we propose a new automatic extractive text summarization technique based on graph representation that makes use of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), an ontology knowledge from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). We combined the graph building rules with a distance function between text documents, called Word Mover’s Distance. To prioritize the core sentences, we extracted the summary by using a popular graph-based method from Google, PageRank. We compared our results with other text summarization software using 400 biological review papers as a corpus randomly sampled from PubMed Central. Our approach outperformed the baseline comparators in terms of Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores.","['BME', 'EDU']",extractive text summarization use ontology and graph base method ieee in recent year many people start to take care of the physical health the biomedical article be the trendy issue at the moment lead to the huge amount of knowledge create rapidly in this paper we propose a new automatic extractive text summarization technique base on graph representation that make use of the unified medical language system umls an ontology knowledge from the national library of medicine nlm we combine the graph building rule with a distance function between text document call word mover s distance to prioritize the core sentence we extract the summary by use a popular graph base method from google pagerank we compare our result with other text summarization software use biological review paper as a corpus randomly sample from pubmed central our approach outperform the baseline comparator in term of recall orient understudy for giste evaluation rouge score
67,A concept of demand charge subsidy due to wheeling charge in distribution system,"© 2019 IEEE.Industrial estates in Thailand, which typically receive electricity supply from distribution systems, can directly get supplied from private power producers in the local area. With this, private power producers and transaction customers need to pay wheeling charge to the main electric utility. Therefore, the demand charge of the entire customers should be decreased due to an increase of sharing customers. This paper proposes a concept of demand charge subsidy calculation for existing distribution customers due to wheeling charge. Because of the simplicity of postage stamp method and the reflection of extent of use of power flow based MW-Mile method, these methods are focused in this paper.

68,Predicting judicial decisions of criminal cases from Thai supreme court using bi-directional gru with attention mechanism,"© 2018 IEEE.Predicting court judgement has gained growing attention over the past years. Prior attempts used traditional prediction techniques based on Bag of words (BoW), where the order of words is discarded, resulting in low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of criminal cases from Thai Supreme Court using End-To-End Deep Learning Neural Networks. Our model imitates a process of legal interpretation, whereby recurrent neural networks read the fact from an input case and compare them against relevant legal provisions with the attention mechanism. The model's output shows if a person is guilty of a crime according to the fact and laws. After the performance test, we find that our model could yield the higher F1 than traditional text classification techniques including Naive Bayes and SVM. In addition, we innovate the open dataset called 'Thai Supreme Court Cases (TSCC)' that was compiled from many decades of Thai Supreme Court criminal judgements. It features the text of fact expertly extracted from each judgement, textual provisions from Thai Criminal Code, and binary-format labels following the theoretical criminal law structure. This dataset is useful for achieving judgement predicting task together with emulating actual criminal case trial.","['EE', 'EDU']",predict judicial decision of criminal case from thai supreme court use bi directional gru with attention mechanism ieee predict court judgement have gain grow attention over the past year prior attempt use traditional prediction technique base on bag of word bow where the order of word be discard result in low accuracy in this paper we propose a prediction model of criminal case from thai supreme court use end to end deep learn neural network our model imitate a process of legal interpretation whereby recurrent neural network read the fact from an input case and compare they against relevant legal provision with the attention mechanism the model s output show if a person be guilty of a crime accord to the fact and law after the performance test we find that our model could yield the high f than traditional text classification technique include naive baye and svm in addition we innovate the open dataset call thai supreme court case tscc that be compile from many decade of thai supreme court criminal judgement it feature the text of fact expertly extract from each judgement textual provision from thai criminal code and binary format label follow the theoretical criminal law structure this dataset be useful for achieve judgement predict task together with emulate actual criminal case trial

70,"Deep percolation characteristics via field soil moisture sensors - Case study in Phitsanulok, Thailand","© 2019, Taiwan Water Conservancy.This study developed the field measurement of soil moisture via sensor system to investigate deep percolation characteristics in the Rice Water Use Experimental Lab of Royal Irrigation Department in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. From soil moisture field monitored at four depths, Hydrus-1D was applied to simulate water movement with soil hydraulic parameter estimates using field data for calibration. To understand deep percolation characteristics, rainfall, irrigation water and evaporation (called effective infiltration) inputs were monitored and used to simulate the effect of the pronounced climatic gradient (precipitation) and soil depths variability on percolation fluxes and applied the calibrated model. The effective infiltration and percolation at 2m depth is applied to detect the deep percolation changes and are described in the wetting and drying stages of soil. The study found that the effect of evaporation makes different percolation characteristics at shallower (1 m) and deeper (2 m) of soil layers. The daily maximum deep percolation (at 2 m) is 4.43 cm/ day when the soil moisture is saturated at 39%. The average rate of percolation (at 2 m) in the study period is 0.52 cm/day from the total input of effective infiltration. The percolation rate increased in soil with higher effective infiltration rate, deeper water table, soil moisture value in the subsoil (between saturation and field capacity). The ratio of total deep percolation and effective infiltration is 0.19 and the total deep percolation is 0.42 of rainfall plus irrigation in the rainy season. This study provided the understandings of deep percolation characteristics, its percolation rate and overall water balance of deep percolation system by using Hydrus-1D model with calibrated data from soil moisture sensors in the field.","['ENV', 'PE', 'CHE', 'AGRI']",deep percolation characteristic via field soil moisture sensor case study in phitsanulok thailand taiwan water conservancy this study develop the field measurement of soil moisture via sensor system to investigate deep percolation characteristic in the rice water use experimental lab of royal irrigation department in phitsanulok province thailand from soil moisture field monitor at four depth hydrus d be apply to simulate water movement with soil hydraulic parameter estimate use field datum for calibration to understand deep percolation characteristic rainfall irrigation water and evaporation call effective infiltration input be monitor and use to simulate the effect of the pronounce climatic gradient precipitation and soil depth variability on percolation flux and apply the calibrate model the effective infiltration and percolation at m depth be apply to detect the deep percolation change and be describe in the wetting and dry stage of soil the study find that the effect of evaporation make different percolation characteristic at shallower m and deep m of soil layer the daily maximum deep percolation at m be cm day when the soil moisture be saturate at the average rate of percolation at m in the study period be cm day from the total input of effective infiltration the percolation rate increase in soil with high effective infiltration rate deep water table soil moisture value in the subsoil between saturation and field capacity the ratio of total deep percolation and effective infiltration be and the total deep percolation be of rainfall plus irrigation in the rainy season this study provide the understanding of deep percolation characteristic its percolation rate and overall water balance of deep percolation system by use hydrus d model with calibrate datum from soil moisture sensor in the field

72,Environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability from intensive agricultural practices in Thailand,"© 2020 22nd Congress of the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research-Asia Pacific Division, IAHR-APD 2020: ""Creating Resilience to Water-Related Challenges"". All rights reserved.Irrigation has contributed significantly to poverty alleviation, food security, and improving the quality of life for rural populations. However, infiltration of irrigation water in excess of available root zone storage from agricultural lands with poorer water quality may carry both agricultural chemicals and naturally recharge to groundwater, rivers, and lakes. In recent years water security concerns have centered on groundwater depletion by withdrawals for irrigated agriculture and groundwater quality degradation both from natural and anthropogenic origin, and only limited attention has been paid to the more insidious (and more chronic) problems of progressive aquifer contamination of groundwater recharge by irrigation return flows, which is occurring in major intensive agricultural practices. Environmental vulnerability and risk assessment is a step towards identification, analysis, and classification of vulnerable and risk factors as well as its long-term implications, and thus reduction of the possibility of adverse consequences from irrigation, are the primary objective of this present study. A novel approach for environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability assessment is initiated and applied by combining a novel aquifer vulnerability DRASTIC map with pollution severity and prioritization based in probability of occurrence of pollution using TOPSIS ranking method. 9% of the total study area is categorized as high risk level which needs intensive groundwater samples from domestic and monitoring wells at various depths (100 samples from <30 m deep, and 60 samples from >60 m deep) are collected and analyzed for nitrate (as NO3-), K. sulphate (as SO42-) and other water quality parameters. NO3- level in groundwater ranged from 0.18 to 151 mg/L. Consistent K and NO3- trends from municipal wells in the study area indicate that nitrate source is likely agricultural origin. Detection of high nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater suggests the direct association of major nitrate concentration in groundwater aquifer with potential surficial source on the ground.","['ENV', 'CHE', 'AGRI', 'EDU', 'SAFETY']",environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability from intensive agricultural practice in thailand nd congress of the international association for hydro environment engineering and research asia pacific division iahr apd create resilience to water relate challenge all right reserve irrigation have contribute significantly to poverty alleviation food security and improve the quality of life for rural population however infiltration of irrigation water in excess of available root zone storage from agricultural land with poor water quality may carry both agricultural chemical and naturally recharge to groundwater river and lake in recent year water security concern have center on groundwater depletion by withdrawal for irrigate agriculture and groundwater quality degradation both from natural and anthropogenic origin and only limited attention have be pay to the more insidious and more chronic problem of progressive aquifer contamination of groundwater recharge by irrigation return flow which be occur in major intensive agricultural practice environmental vulnerability and risk assessment be a step towards identification analysis and classification of vulnerable and risk factor as well as its long term implication and thus reduction of the possibility of adverse consequence from irrigation be the primary objective of this present study a novel approach for environmental impact of irrigation to groundwater contamination and aquifer vulnerability assessment be initiate and apply by combine a novel aquifer vulnerability drastic map with pollution severity and prioritization base in probability of occurrence of pollution use topsis ranking method of the total study area be categorize as high risk level which need intensive groundwater sample from domestic and monitor well at various depth sample from m deep and sample from m deep be collect and analyze for nitrate as no k sulphate as so and other water quality parameter no level in groundwater range from to mg l consistent k and no trend from municipal well in the study area indicate that nitrate source be likely agricultural origin detection of high nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater suggest the direct association of major nitrate concentration in groundwater aquifer with potential surficial source on the ground

Despite the porous structure, these porous ZnV2O4 NWs are single crystal with {220} facets and a wire direction along the c-axis. On the basis of an electrochemical test, these porous ZnV2O4 NWs have better cycling stability and higher specific capacity (i.e., 460 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles and 149 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles using 1 and 5 A g-1 current densities, respectively) compared to other morphologies (i.e., spherical and coral-like morphologies). As a ternary transition metal oxide, the produced porous ZnV2O4 NWs undergo phase transformation without compromising the resulting capacity. On the other hand, the CV curves at different scan rates indicate a pseudocapacitive electrochemical behavior of the porous ZnV2O4.","['METAL', 'NANO', 'MATSCI']",porous znv o nanowire for stable and high rate lithium ion battery anode american chemical society porous znv o nanowire nws be successfully prepare by hydrothermal reaction follow by calcination despite the porous structure these porous znv o nws be single crystal with facet and a wire direction along the c axis on the basis of an electrochemical test these porous znv o nws have well cycling stability and high specific capacity I e ma h g after cycle and ma h g after cycle use and a g current density respectively compare to other morphology I e spherical and coral like morphology as a ternary transition metal oxide the produce porous znv o nws undergo phase transformation without compromise the result capacity on the other hand the cv curve at different scan rate indicate a pseudocapacitive electrochemical behavior of the porous znv o
75,Starbursts in and out of the star-formation main sequence,"© ESO 2018.Aims. We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface density of star formation in z ∼ 2 galaxies and study the different physical properties between galaxies within and above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. Methods. We use ALMA images at 870 µm with 0.2 arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. Results. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of ∼150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these “starbursts hidden in the main sequence” also exist below 1011 M. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.","['ENV', 'EE']",starburst in and out of the star formation main sequence eso aim we use high resolution continuum image obtain with the atacama large millimeter array alma to probe the surface density of star formation in z galaxy and study the different physical property between galaxy within and above the star formation main sequence of galaxy method we use alma image at µm with arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star form galaxy at z select among the most massive herschel galaxy in the good south field this sample be supplement with eleven galaxy from the public datum of the mm survey of the hubble ultra deep field hudf we derive dust and gas masse for the galaxy compute their depletion time and gas fraction and study the relative distribution of rest frame ultraviolet uv and far infrare fir light result alma reveal systematically dense concentration of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxy we identify two different starburst regime I the classical population of starburst locate above the sfr m main sequence with enhance gas fraction and short depletion time and ii a sub population of galaxy locate within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescale typical of starburst of myr in both starburst population the fir and uv be distribute in distinct region and dust correct star formation rate sfrs estimate use uv optical near infrared datum alone underestimate the total sfr starburst hide in the main sequence show instead the low gas fraction of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization be herschel select these main sequence galaxy be locate in the high mass end of the main sequence hence we do not know whether these starburst hide in the main sequence also exist below m active galactic nucleus agn be find to be ubiquitous in these compact starburst suggest that the trigger mechanism also feed the central black hole or that the active nucleus trigger star formation

The oscillating bowl was used to make the uniform coating on the substrate. The Cu doping content was varied by adjusting the coating time. The thus-obtained catalysts were characterized by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The photocatalytic activities of all catalysts were studied via the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O to CH4 under UV irradiation, and compared with the pure TiO2 support and conventional-impregnation-made Cu/TiO2. The results showed that the photocatalytic performance of sputtering-made Cu/TiO2 catalyst was much better than the pure TiO2 support.

77,Influence of spatial variability of ground on seismic response analysis: a case study of Bangkok subsoils,"© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The objective of this study was to observe the spatial variation in the geological subsoil condition on the seismic ground response of Bangkok subsoils during the remote 6.8 Mw Tarlay earthquake in 2011 in Northern Thailand. A simulation of random locations was initially performed to define the studied locations. The dynamic parameters, such as the soil index properties, shear modulus, and shear wave velocity, were determined from the subsurface modeling of Bangkok subsoils. Next-generation attenuation analysis was performed to define the input ground motion at each investigated site. Non-linear one-dimensional site response analysis was performed to investigate the surface ground motion, amplification factor, and spectral acceleration during short (0.2 s) and long (1 s) time periods. In general, it is important to consider the ground spatial variation in any seismic ground response analysis. The results show that Bangkok subsoils could magnify the seismic wave during an earthquake. For example, in the 2011 Tarlay earthquake, the magnification varied from two- to four-fold. The results from this study can be used to define the microzonation of the ground motion characteristic of Bangkok subsoils, such as the peak ground acceleration and the spectral acceleration, at short and long periods.","['PE', 'ME', 'MATSCI']",influence of spatial variability of ground on seismic response analysis a case study of bangkok subsoil springer verlag gmbh germany part of springer nature the objective of this study be to observe the spatial variation in the geological subsoil condition on the seismic ground response of bangkok subsoil during the remote mw tarlay earthquake in in northern thailand a simulation of random location be initially perform to define the study location the dynamic parameter such as the soil index property shear modulus and shear wave velocity be determine from the subsurface modeling of bangkok subsoil next generation attenuation analysis be perform to define the input ground motion at each investigate site non linear one dimensional site response analysis be perform to investigate the surface ground motion amplification factor and spectral acceleration during short s and long s time period in general it be important to consider the ground spatial variation in any seismic ground response analysis the result show that bangkok subsoil could magnify the seismic wave during an earthquake for example in the tarlay earthquake the magnification vary from two to four fold the result from this study can be use to define the microzonation of the ground motion characteristic of bangkok subsoil such as the peak ground acceleration and the spectral acceleration at short and long period
78,Synergistic effect of Thiourea and HCl on Palladium (II) recovery: An investigation on Chemical structures and thermodynamic stability via DFT,"© 2021 The Author(s)This work duly investigates the recovery of Pd (II) chlorocomplexes from industrial wastewater. Chemical structures and thermodynamic stabilities of the complex formed are evaluated via density functional theory (DFT). By applying synergistic solutions of thiourea mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl), the stripping reaction of Pd (II) in the loaded Aliquat 336 occurs and Pd (II) chlorocomplexes coordinated thiourea ligands are formed, thus 80.19% of Pd (II) chlorocomplexes can be recovered. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the stripping mechanisms and the structure of the complexes formed via the synergistic system. Such an understanding is still limited since little research has been conducted in this field. Owing to their molecular geometry, ligand coordination and donor groups play a vital role in the reactivity of palladium (II) complex. Quantum models have been developed to evaluate the chemical structure and thermodynamics stability of ((NH2)2CS·PdCl2) namely: (i) DFT with B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) and MP2/6-31g(d,p) basis set, (ii) MP2 with cc-pVTZ basis set and (iii) CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ. Results demonstrate that the highest geometric stability exhibited is the structure of Pd-S bonding with 180° Cl-Pd-Cl.

79,Utilization of bottom ash for degraded soil improvement for sustainable technology,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Bottom ash is one of the main products from coal combustion in coal-fired power plants. It has been applied in many applications such as landfill, cement industry or raw feed for clinker, concrete, etc. Furthermore, it can be used in agriculture to improve soil quality. However, the utilization rate of bottom ash in agriculture is still very low only 0.1% of bottom ash. The properties of bottom ash can adjust the pH in soil and provide some nutrients to improve soil quality. Moreover, the soil degradation is a major problem in agricultural countries. The soil degradation is the decline in soil quality due to the improper land use, agriculture with misuse or excess use of fertilizers and so on. In Thailand, the soil degradation is a serious problem in agriculture in the northern mountainous areas. The mainly causes of soil degradation are from human activities such as overuse of pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer, deforestation, expansion of cultivated areas. Therefore, the objective of this research is to apply the bottom ash from Mae-Moh power plant to improve soil quality of degraded soil in Nan province, Thailand and to investigate the effects of amount of bottom ash from 0-30% by weight on some parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density and soil texture. From the result, it is clear that with higher amount of bottom ash, the quality of degraded soil has been improved especially pH and soil texture. The pH can increase from 5.664 up to 7.408. Soil texture can change from clay to loam or sandy loam. The bulk density of soil decreases at all rates of bottom ash which is favorable for plant growth. This research can be applied for soil amendment and is expected to improve the yield for plant growing. Furthermore, the practical combinations of 10% and 20% of bottom ash are considered to apply in the real field to evaluate the improvement on soil properties in the future.","['CE', 'ENV', 'PE', 'CHE', 'AGRI']",utilization of bottom ash for degraded soil improvement for sustainable technology publish under licence by iop publish ltd bottom ash be one of the main product from coal combustion in coal fire power plant it have be apply in many application such as landfill cement industry or raw feed for clinker concrete etc furthermore it can be use in agriculture to improve soil quality however the utilization rate of bottom ash in agriculture be still very low only of bottom ash the property of bottom ash can adjust the ph in soil and provide some nutrient to improve soil quality moreover the soil degradation be a major problem in agricultural country the soil degradation be the decline in soil quality due to the improper land use agriculture with misuse or excess use of fertilizer and so on in thailand the soil degradation be a serious problem in agriculture in the northern mountainous area the mainly cause of soil degradation be from human activity such as overuse of pesticide herbicide and fertilizer deforestation expansion of cultivate area therefore the objective of this research be to apply the bottom ash from mae moh power plant to improve soil quality of degraded soil in nan province thailand and to investigate the effect of amount of bottom ash from by weight on some parameter such as ph electrical conductivity ec bulk density and soil texture from the result it be clear that with high amount of bottom ash the quality of degraded soil have be improve especially ph and soil texture the ph can increase from up to soil texture can change from clay to loam or sandy loam the bulk density of soil decrease at all rate of bottom ash which be favorable for plant growth this research can be apply for soil amendment and be expect to improve the yield for plant grow furthermore the practical combination of and of bottom ash be consider to apply in the real field to evaluate the improvement on soil property in the future
80,Analysis of the equivalent dipole moment of red blood cell by using the boundary element method,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdEquivalent dipole moment of biological cells under electric field is an important parameter for various applications such as analysis and manipulation of cells in biomedical samples. The dipole moment depends on cell geometries as well as electrical parameters of media involved. Unfortunately, the analytical expression of equivalent dipole is available only for simple geometries. This work numerically studies the variation of the dipole moment of a red blood cell with cell geometries and electrical parameters. The cell is modelled as a sphere, an oblate spheroid or a biconcave disc. The authors apply the boundary element method to electric field calculation and use re-expansion formulae to compute the equivalent dipole moment of the cell. The numerical results agree well with the analytical one for the spherical model. The effects of cell geometries are clarified for two directions of the electric field, which are parallel or normal to the axis of symmetry of the cell. Using the biconcave disc model, we perform iterative calculation to estimate the intracellular conductivity and specific membrane capacitance of red blood cells from experimental results.","['BME', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATH']",analysis of the equivalent dipole moment of red blood cell by use the boundary element method elsevi ltdequivalent dipole moment of biological cell under electric field be an important parameter for various application such as analysis and manipulation of cell in biomedical sample the dipole moment depend on cell geometry as well as electrical parameter of medium involve unfortunately the analytical expression of equivalent dipole be available only for simple geometry this work numerically study the variation of the dipole moment of a red blood cell with cell geometry and electrical parameter the cell be model as a sphere an oblate spheroid or a biconcave disc the author apply the boundary element method to electric field calculation and use re expansion formulae to compute the equivalent dipole moment of the cell the numerical result agree well with the analytical one for the spherical model the effect of cell geometry be clarify for two direction of the electric field which be parallel or normal to the axis of symmetry of the cell use the biconcave disc model we perform iterative calculation to estimate the intracellular conductivity and specific membrane capacitance of red blood cell from experimental result

82,Effect of Water Content in Waste Cooking Oil on Biodiesel Production via Ester-transesterification in a Single Reactive Distillation,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.A single-column reactive distillation is employed to convert waste cooking oil to biodiesel via simultaneous esterification and transesterification reactions. The waste cooking oil contained 10 wt% of free fatty acid (FFA) and the contaminated water (2-8 wt%) was used as feedstocks for biodiesel production. Esterification was occurred in the upper of column to reduce FFA content to less than 1 wt% and to prevent the simultaneous saponification by base catalyst. Moreover, the contaminated water and by-product water (from esterification) together was removed in-situ as the distillate product. The reactive distillation has been optimally designed to have 16 stages consisting of 5 esterification, 9 transesterification stages and each stage for reboiler and condenser. The feed locations of oil and methanol were at the top of the column and at stage 6, respectively. The optimum methanol to oil ratio was 6:1 with reflux ratio 0.1 while the reboiler duty was in the range of 100-150 kW depended on the water content. This condition successfully converts 97 wt% of waste cooking oil to biodiesel with 96.5% purity.","['ENV', 'PE', 'CHE']",effect of water content in waste cooking oil on biodiesel production via ester transesterification in a single reactive distillation publish under licence by iop publish ltd a single column reactive distillation be employ to convert waste cook oil to biodiesel via simultaneous esterification and transesterification reaction the waste cook oil contain wt of free fatty acid ffa and the contaminated water wt be use as feedstock for biodiesel production esterification be occur in the upper of column to reduce ffa content to less than wt and to prevent the simultaneous saponification by base catalyst moreover the contaminated water and by product water from esterification together be remove in situ as the distillate product the reactive distillation have be optimally design to have stage consist of esterification transesterification stage and each stage for reboiler and condenser the feed location of oil and methanol be at the top of the column and at stage respectively the optimum methanol to oil ratio be with reflux ratio while the reboiler duty be in the range of kw depend on the water content this condition successfully convert wt of waste cook oil to biodiesel with purity
83,Numerical investigation of Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor for volatile organic compounds biomarker (VOCs) detection,© 2021 SPIE.A numerical modelling to theoretically investigate and analyse the characteristic of the surface functionalised optical fibre based sensor to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) biomarker is introduced in this paper. A 125-micron diameter of coreless silica fibre (CSF) connected to single-mode fibre (SMF) at both ends to achieve a structure of SMF-CSF-SMG is proposed to detect VOCs biomarkers for diabetes such as acetone and isopropanol. The coreless fibre region is considered to be a sensing region where the multimode interference (MMI) occurs having a higher light interaction at the interface between the fibre and sensing medium which leads to the enhancement of sensitivity. The sensing region undergoes surface functionalisation with Au-silane for the sensor to be selectively detect VOCs biomarker with electrostatic absorption. The length of the sensing region is numerically optimised to achieve a reimaging distance where the highest possible of coupling efficiency occurs and the maximum output signal can be obtained. Coupling efficiency spectra at different volume fractions of gold nanoparticles with various acetone and isopropanol concentrations are also presented. A sensitivity of the Au-silane functionalised optical fibre sensor is achieved by using the analysis of wavelength shift interrogation. The results show the spectra undergoes red-shift phenomenon in the near-infrared region (NIR) when concentrations of acetone and isopropanol are increased. The functionalisation of Au-silane on the optical fibre sensor provides a higher sensitivity compared to the unfunctionalised sensor as it shows more dramatic shifts of absorption spectra when there is a change in VOCs biomarker concentration.,"['BME', 'OPTIC', 'CHE', 'IE']",numerical investigation of au silane functionalise optical fibre sensor for volatile organic compound biomarker vocs detection spie a numerical modelling to theoretically investigate and analyse the characteristic of the surface functionalise optical fibre base sensor to detect volatile organic compound vocs biomarker be introduce in this paper a micron diameter of coreless silica fibre csf connect to single mode fibre smf at both end to achieve a structure of smf csf smg be propose to detect vocs biomarker for diabete such as acetone and isopropanol the coreless fibre region be consider to be a sense region where the multimode interference mmi occur have a high light interaction at the interface between the fibre and sensing medium which lead to the enhancement of sensitivity the sense region undergoes surface functionalisation with au silane for the sensor to be selectively detect vocs biomarker with electrostatic absorption the length of the sense region be numerically optimise to achieve a reimage distance where the high possible of couple efficiency occur and the maximum output signal can be obtain couple efficiency spectra at different volume fraction of gold nanoparticle with various acetone and isopropanol concentration be also present a sensitivity of the au silane functionalise optical fibre sensor be achieve by use the analysis of wavelength shift interrogation the result show the spectra undergoes red shift phenomenon in the near infrared region nir when concentration of acetone and isopropanol be increase the functionalisation of au silane on the optical fibre sensor provide a high sensitivity compare to the unfunctionalised sensor as it show more dramatic shift of absorption spectra when there be a change in vocs biomarker concentration

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.For future healthcare applications, which are increasingly moving towards out-of-hospital or home-based caring models, the ability to remotely and continuously monitor patients’ conditions effectively are imperative. Among others, emotional state is one of the conditions that could be of interest to doctors or caregivers. This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07% accuracy (valence), 72.89% accuracy (arousal), and 53.72% (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.","['BME', 'EE']",a wearable in ear eeg device for emotion monitoring by the author licensee mdpi basel switzerland for future healthcare application which be increasingly move towards out of hospital or home base caring model the ability to remotely and continuously monitor patient condition effectively be imperative among other emotional state be one of the condition that could be of interest to doctor or caregiver this paper discuss a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that be a low cost single channel dry contact in ear eeg suitable for non intrusive monitoring all aspect of the design engineering and experiment by apply machine learn for emotion classification be cover base on the valence and arousal emotion model the device be able to classify basic emotion with accuracy valence accuracy arousal and all four emotion the result be comparable to those measure from the more conventional eeg headset at t and t scalp position these result together with its earphone like wearability suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare application such as home base or tele monitoring system as intend
86,Drift-flux correlation for gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe,"© 2017 Elsevier Inc.A drift-flux correlation has been often used to predict void fraction of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal channel due to its simplicity and practicality. The drift-flux correlation includes two important drift-flux parameters, namely, the distribution parameter and void-fraction-weighted-mean drift velocity. In this study, an extensive literature survey for horizontal two-phase flow is conducted to establish void fraction database and to acquire existing drift-flux correlations. A total of 566 data is collected from 12 data sources and 4 flow-regime-dependent and 1 flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlations are identified. The predictive capability of the existing drift-flux correlations is assessed using the collected data. It is pointed out that the drift velocity determined by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity. In this study, a simple flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlation is developed. In the modeling approach, the void-fraction-weighted mean drift velocity is approximated to be 0 m/s, whereas the distribution parameter is given as a simple function of the ratio of non-dimensional superficial gas velocity to non-dimensional mixture volumetric flux. The newly developed correlation shows an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two-phase flow. Mean absolute error (or bias), standard deviation (random error), mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation are 0.0487, 0.0985, 0.0758 and 0.206, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the correlation is similar to the correlation of Chexal et al. (1991), which was formulated based on the drift-flux parameters by means of many cascading constitutive relationships with numerous empirical parameters.","['ME', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",drift flux correlation for gas liquid two phase flow in a horizontal pipe elsevier inc a drift flux correlation have be often use to predict void fraction of gas liquid two phase flow in a horizontal channel due to its simplicity and practicality the drift flux correlation include two important drift flux parameter namely the distribution parameter and void fraction weight mean drift velocity in this study an extensive literature survey for horizontal two phase flow be conduct to establish void fraction database and to acquire exist drift flux correlation a total of datum be collect from data source and flow regime dependent and flow regime independent drift flux correlation be identify the predictive capability of the exist drift flux correlation be assess use the collect datum it be point out that the drift velocity determine by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity in this study a simple flow regime independent drift flux correlation be develop in the modeling approach the void fraction weight mean drift velocity be approximate to be m s whereas the distribution parameter be give as a simple function of the ratio of non dimensional superficial gas velocity to non dimensional mixture volumetric flux the newly develop correlation show an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two phase flow mean absolute error or bias standard deviation random error mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation be and respectively the prediction accuracy of the correlation be similar to the correlation of chexal et al which be formulate base on the drift flux parameter by mean of many cascade constitutive relationship with numerous empirical parameter

88,Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction Using Event Embedding and Technical Indicators,"© 2018 IEEE.Recently, ability to handle tremendous amounts of information using increased computational capabilities has improved prediction of stock market behavior. Complex machine learning algorithms such as deep learning methods can analyze and detect complex data patterns. The recent prediction models use two types of inputs as (i) numerical information such as historical prices and technical indicators, and (ii) textual information including news contents or headlines. However, the use of textual data involves text representation construction. Traditional methods like word embedding may not be suitable for representing the semantics of financial news due to problems of word sparsity in datasets. In this paper, we aim to improve stock market predictions using a deep learning approach with event embedding vectors extracted from news headlines, historical price data, and a set of technical indicators as input. Our prediction model consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) architectures. We use accuracy and annualized return based on trading simulation as performance metrics, and then perform experiments on three datasets obtained from different news sources namely Reuters, Reddit, and Intrinio. Results show that enhancing text representation vectors and considering both numerical and textual information as input to a deep neural network can improve prediction performance.","['BME', 'EE', 'CPE']",deep learning for stock market prediction use event embed and technical indicator ieee recently ability to handle tremendous amount of information use increase computational capability have improve prediction of stock market behavior complex machine learning algorithm such as deep learning method can analyze and detect complex datum pattern the recent prediction model use two type of input as I numerical information such as historical price and technical indicator and ii textual information include news content or headline however the use of textual datum involve text representation construction traditional method like word embed may not be suitable for represent the semantic of financial news due to problem of word sparsity in dataset in this paper we aim to improve stock market prediction use a deep learning approach with event embed vector extract from news headline historical price datum and a set of technical indicator as input our prediction model consist of convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm architecture we use accuracy and annualize return base on trading simulation as performance metric and then perform experiment on three dataset obtain from different news source namely reuter reddit and intrinio result show that enhance text representation vector and consider both numerical and textual information as input to a deep neural network can improve prediction performance

91,Development of a restraining wall and screw-extractor discharge system for continuous jig separation of mixed plastics,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdBatch and continuous jig experiments were compared using plastic mixtures with different light and heavy particle ratios. The purity of bottom layer products of continuous jig was lower than those of batch jig because of light particle entrainment induced by the screw-type extractor. To minimize entrainment, a new discharge system consisting of a vertical restraining wall and a screw-type extractor was developed. The restraining wall was installed close to the “product-end” to separate the jig chamber into two and allow particles to transfer from one part to the other via the gap under the wall. The experimental results showed that this proposed discharge system could improve the purity of heavy particles in bottom layer products because of two reasons: (1) higher material mass ratio of heavy plastic close to product-end, and (2) changes in the flow of water and particles. Moreover, the purity of bottom layer products during continuous jig separation was influenced by the difference of material mass ratio in feed; that is, purity was higher when the ratio of heavy plastic was high. In addition, an estimation procedure based on multi-step treatment using separation curves is proposed to achieve the target purity of bottom layer products.","['ENV', 'ME']",development of a restraining wall and screw extractor discharge system for continuous jig separation of mixed plastic elsevi ltdbatch and continuous jig experiment be compare use plastic mixture with different light and heavy particle ratio the purity of bottom layer product of continuous jig be low than those of batch jig because of light particle entrainment induce by the screw type extractor to minimize entrainment a new discharge system consist of a vertical restraining wall and a screw type extractor be develop the restraining wall be instal close to the product end to separate the jig chamber into two and allow particle to transfer from one part to the other via the gap under the wall the experimental result show that this propose discharge system could improve the purity of heavy particle in bottom layer product because of two reason high material mass ratio of heavy plastic close to product end and change in the flow of water and particle moreover the purity of bottom layer product during continuous jig separation be influence by the difference of material mass ratio in feed that be purity be high when the ratio of heavy plastic be high in addition an estimation procedure base on multi step treatment use separation curve be propose to achieve the target purity of bottom layer product
92,MHCSeqNet: A deep neural network model for universal MHC binding prediction,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Immunotherapy is an emerging approach in cancer treatment that activates the host immune system to destroy cancer cells expressing unique peptide signatures (neoepitopes). Administrations of cancer-specific neoepitopes in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have been proven effective in both mouse models and human patients. Because only a tiny fraction of cancer-specific neoepitopes actually elicits immune response, selection of potent, immunogenic neoepitopes remains a challenging step in cancer vaccine development. A basic approach for immunogenicity prediction is based on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) with high affinity. Results: In this study, we developed MHCSeqNet, an open-source deep learning model, which not only outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on both MHC binding affinity and MHC ligand peptidome datasets but also exhibits promising generalization to unseen MHC class I alleles. MHCSeqNet employed neural network architectures developed for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representations of MHC allele and epitope peptide as sentences with amino acids as individual words. This consideration allows MHCSeqNet to accept new MHC alleles as well as peptides of any length. Conclusions: The improved performance and the flexibility offered by MHCSeqNet should make it a valuable tool for screening effective neoepitopes in cancer vaccine development.","['BME', 'CPE', 'CHE']",mhcseqnet a deep neural network model for universal mhc bind prediction the author s background immunotherapy be an emerge approach in cancer treatment that activate the host immune system to destroy cancer cell express unique peptide signature neoepitope administration of cancer specific neoepitope in the form of synthetic peptide vaccine have be prove effective in both mouse model and human patient because only a tiny fraction of cancer specific neoepitope actually elicit immune response selection of potent immunogenic neoepitope remain a challenging step in cancer vaccine development a basic approach for immunogenicity prediction be base on the premise that effective neoepitope should bind with the major histocompatibility complex mhc with high affinity result in this study we develop mhcseqnet an open source deep learning model which not only outperform state of the art predictor on both mhc bind affinity and mhc ligand peptidome dataset but also exhibit promising generalization to unseen mhc class I allele mhcseqnet employ neural network architecture develop for natural language processing to model amino acid sequence representation of mhc allele and epitope peptide as sentence with amino acid as individual word this consideration allow mhcseqnet to accept new mhc allele as well as peptide of any length conclusion the improved performance and the flexibility offer by mhcseqnet should make it a valuable tool for screen effective neoepitope in cancer vaccine development
93,Impact of AlCl3 and FeCl2 Addition on Catalytic Behaviors of TiCl4/MgCl2/THF Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization and Ethylene/1-Hexene Copolymerization,"Copyright © 2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The present research focuses on elucidating of the impact of Lewis acids including AlCl3 and FeCl2 addition on catalytic behaviors during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization over the TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalyst (Cat. A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail.","['CHE', 'MATENG']",impact of alcl and fecl addition on catalytic behavior of ticl mgcl thf catalyst for ethylene polymerization and ethylene hexene copolymerization copyright bcrec group all right reserve the present research focus on elucidate of the impact of lewis acid include alcl and fecl addition on catalytic behavior during ethylene polymerization and ethylene hexene copolymerization over the ticl mgcl thf catalyst cat a in this study the cat a with the absence and presence of lewis acid be synthesize via the chemical route then all catalyst sample be characterize and test in the slurry polymerization for ethylene polymerization use the cat a with the presence of alcl apparently give the high activity among other catalyst in addition the activity of catalyst tend to increase with the presence of the lewis acid this can be attribute to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of lewis acid lead to large amount of the isolated ti specie moreover with the presence of lewis acid the effect of hydrogen on the decrease activity be also less pronounced consider ethylene hexene copolymerization it reveal that the catalyst with the presence of mixed lewis acid alcl fecl exhibit the high activity it be suggest that the presence of mixed lewis acid possibly cause a change in acidity of active site which be suitable for copolymerization however activity of all catalyst in ethylene hexene copolymerization be low than those in ethylene polymerization the effect of hydrogen on the decrease activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system be find to be similar with the presence of lewis acid base on this study it be quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper lewis acid especially when the pressure of hydrogen increase the characteristic of polymer obtain upon the presence of lewis acid will be discuss far in more detail
94,Modular transformation of embedded systems from firm-cores to soft-cores,"Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.Although there are many 8-bit IP processor cores available, only a few, such as Xilinx PicoBlaze and Lattice Mico8 firm-cores are reliable enough to be used in commercial products. One of the drawbacks is that their codes are confined to vendor-specific primitives. It is inefficient to implement a PicoBlaze processor on non-Xilinx FPGA devices. In this paper we propose a systematic approach that transforms primitive-level designs (firm-cores) to vendor independent designs (soft-cores), while modularising them during the process.

95,Thermodynamic analysis of the novel chemical looping process for two-grade hydrogen production with CO2 capture,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe integrated sorption-enhanced chemical looping reforming and water splitting (SECLR-WS) process was proposed for hydrogen (H2) production from biogas using iron oxide as an oxygen carrier and calcium oxide (CaO) as a carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorbent. In the SECLR-WS process, the biogas feed is partially oxidized using iron oxide and CO2 is captured by CaO in the fuel reactor (FR) to produce H2-rich syngas. The iron oxide is re-oxidized in the steam reactor (SR) to generate a high-purity H2 stream and CaO is regenerated in the calcinator. The simulation of the SECLR-WS process was based on a thermodynamic approach and was performed using an Aspen Plus simulator. The effects of key parameters such as the steam feed to the FR to methane (SFR/CH4) and iron (II, III) oxide (Fe3O4) to CH4 (Fe3O4/CH4) molar ratios on the process performance in terms of H2 yield and purity, and CH4 conversion were investigated. The results showed that the H2 yield, H2 purity in the FR, and CH4 conversion could be improved by increasing the SFR/CH4 and CaO/CH4 molar ratios. A total H2 yield of 3.8 and a H2 purity in the FR of 97.01 mol% can be obtained at the FR and SR temperatures of 610 and 500 °C, and SFR/CH4, CaO/CH4, Fe3O4/CH4, and SSR/CH4 molar ratios of 2.2, 1.66, 1, and 2.87, respectively. The molar concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the high-purity H2 stream could be reduced by increasing the pressure in the SR and the amount of CO2 in the biogas feed stream negatively affected the performance of the system. In addition, increasing the Fe3O4/CH4 molar ratio can improve the heat demand in the FR.","['PE', 'CPE', 'CHE']",thermodynamic analysis of the novel chemical looping process for two grade hydrogen production with co capture elsevi ltdthe integrate sorption enhance chemical looping reform and water splitting seclr ws process be propose for hydrogen h production from biogas use iron oxide as an oxygen carrier and calcium oxide cao as a carbon dioxide co adsorbent in the seclr ws process the biogas feed be partially oxidize use iron oxide and co be capture by cao in the fuel reactor fr to produce h rich syngas the iron oxide be re oxidize in the steam reactor sr to generate a high purity h stream and cao be regenerate in the calcinator the simulation of the seclr ws process be base on a thermodynamic approach and be perform use an aspen plus simulator the effect of key parameter such as the steam feed to the fr to methane sfr ch and iron ii iii oxide fe o to ch fe o ch molar ratio on the process performance in term of h yield and purity and ch conversion be investigate the result show that the h yield h purity in the fr and ch conversion could be improve by increase the sfr ch and cao ch molar ratio a total h yield of and a h purity in the fr of mol can be obtain at the fr and sr temperature of and c and sfr ch cao ch fe o ch and ssr ch molar ratio of and respectively the molar concentration of carbon monoxide co in the high purity h stream could be reduce by increase the pressure in the sr and the amount of co in the biogas feed stream negatively affect the performance of the system in addition increase the fe o ch molar ratio can improve the heat demand in the fr

The NWs are grown by self-catalyzed molecular beam epitaxy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses demonstrate that the GaAsP NW core develops an inverse-tapered shape with a formation of an unintentional GaAsP shell having a lower P content. Without surface passivation, this unintentional shell produces no luminescence because of strong surface recombination. However, passivation of the surface with a GaP shell leads to the appearance of a secondary peak in the luminescence spectrum arising from this unintentional shell. The attribution of the luminescence peaks is confirmed by correlated cathodoluminescence and STEM analyses of the same NW.","['CE', 'METAL', 'OPTIC', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",correlate optical and structural analysis of individual gaasp gap core shell nanowire iop publish ltd we report on the structural and optical property of gaas p gap core shell nanowire nws for future photovoltaic application the nws be grow by self catalyze molecular beam epitaxy scan transmission electron microscopy stem analysis demonstrate that the gaasp nw core develop an inverse taper shape with a formation of an unintentional gaasp shell have a low p content without surface passivation this unintentional shell produce no luminescence because of strong surface recombination however passivation of the surface with a gap shell lead to the appearance of a secondary peak in the luminescence spectrum arise from this unintentional shell the attribution of the luminescence peak be confirm by correlate cathodoluminescence and stem analysis of the same nw
100,Maximizing double-link failure recovery of over-dimensioned optical mesh networks,"© 2019Double-link failure models, in which any two links in the network fail in an arbitrary order, are becoming critical in survivable optical network designs. Optical networks that are over-dimensioned and purposely preplanned for full protection against any single-link failure may not survive well in an event of a double-link failure. It is therefore important to understand how much impact a subsequent second link failure may have upon traffic recovery of both failed links. This paper primarily aims to investigate traffic recoverability when a double-link failure occurs. We propose several methods for improving traffic recovery without using additional backup capacities other than the existing backup resources available for single-link failure recovery. In each proposed method, integer linear programming formulation is derived to optimize the backup resource allocation. Numerical results on various network configurations have shed some light on how network operators can choose one of five alternative methods to better handle a double-link failure. From numerical results, Method 1 offers some improvement on the traffic recoverability of the second failed link without disturbing the recovered traffic of the first failed link. Method 2 reveals that the traffic recoverability of the first failed link can be improved if the backup routes of the unrecovered traffic of the first failed link can be reassigned. Method 3 is useful for maximizing the traffic recoverability of the first failed link. Method 4 further increases the recoverability of the second failed link while maintaining the same recoverability of the first failed link as Method 3. Finally, Method 5 accomplishes the maximum overall traffic recoverability.","['CPE', 'OPTIC', 'MATH']",maximize double link failure recovery of over dimension optical mesh network double link failure model in which any two link in the network fail in an arbitrary order be become critical in survivable optical network design optical network that be over dimensioned and purposely preplanne for full protection against any single link failure may not survive well in an event of a double link failure it be therefore important to understand how much impact a subsequent second link failure may have upon traffic recovery of both fail link this paper primarily aim to investigate traffic recoverability when a double link failure occur we propose several method for improve traffic recovery without use additional backup capacity other than the exist backup resource available for single link failure recovery in each propose method integer linear programming formulation be derive to optimize the backup resource allocation numerical result on various network configuration have shed some light on how network operator can choose one of five alternative method to well handle a double link failure from numerical result method offer some improvement on the traffic recoverability of the second fail link without disturb the recover traffic of the first fail link method reveal that the traffic recoverability of the first fail link can be improve if the backup route of the unrecovered traffic of the first fail link can be reassign method be useful for maximize the traffic recoverability of the first fail link method far increase the recoverability of the second fail link while maintain the same recoverability of the first fail link as method finally method accomplish the maximum overall traffic recoverability

102,Performance comparison among different multifunctional reactors operated under energy self-sufficiency for sustainable hydrogen production from ethanol,"© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCFour ethanol-derived hydrogen production processes including conventional ethanol steam reforming (ESR), sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR), chemical looping reforming (CLR) and sorption enhanced chemical looping reforming (SECLR) were simulated on the basis of energy self-sufficiency, i.e. process energy requirement supplied by burning some of the produced hydrogen. The process performances in terms of hydrogen productivity, hydrogen purity, ethanol conversion, CO2 capture ability and thermal efficiency were compared at their maximized net hydrogen. The simulation results showed that the sorption enhanced processes yield better performances than the conventional ESR and CLR because their in situ CO2 sorption increases hydrogen production and provides heat from the sorption reaction. SECLR is the most promising process as it offers the highest net hydrogen with high-purity hydrogen at low energy requirement. Only 12.5% of the produced hydrogen was diverted into combustion to fulfill the process's energy requirement. The thermal efficiency of SECLR was evaluated at 86% at its optimal condition.","['PE', 'CHE']",performance comparison among different multifunctional reactor operate under energy self sufficiency for sustainable hydrogen production from ethanol hydrogen energy publication llcfour ethanol derive hydrogen production process include conventional ethanol steam reform esr sorption enhance steam reform sesr chemical looping reform clr and sorption enhance chemical looping reform seclr be simulate on the basis of energy self sufficiency I e process energy requirement supply by burn some of the produce hydrogen the process performance in term of hydrogen productivity hydrogen purity ethanol conversion co capture ability and thermal efficiency be compare at their maximized net hydrogen the simulation result show that the sorption enhance process yield well performance than the conventional esr and clr because their in situ co sorption increase hydrogen production and provide heat from the sorption reaction seclr be the most promising process as it offer the high net hydrogen with high purity hydrogen at low energy requirement only of the produce hydrogen be divert into combustion to fulfill the process s energy requirement the thermal efficiency of seclr be evaluate at at its optimal condition
103,Structure and mechanical properties of ADC 12 Al foam-polymer interpenetrating phase composites with epoxy resin or silicone,"© Carl Hanser Verlag, MünchenMetal foam is a high-porosity engineering material which has many outstanding properties such as light weight, high specific strength and stiffness, large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation. The impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces a new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) or co-continuous composites due to the interconnection on a macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This innovative composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results show that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxyresin, results in IPCs stiffer than either of the two individual materials bythemselves. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.","['METAL', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",structure and mechanical property of adc al foam polymer interpenetrate phase composite with epoxy resin or silicone carl hanser verlag münchenmetal foam be a high porosity engineering material which have many outstanding property such as light weight high specific strength and stiffness large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation the impregnation of metal foam with polymer produce a new type of composite such as interpenetrating phase composite ipc or co continuous composite due to the interconnection on a macroscopic level of individual phase as a co continuous d network the coexistence of the metal and polymer phase allow each to contribute its prominent property to the composite this innovative composite material be a potential candidate for application in the automotive and aerospace industry the present study aim to develop two ipc from open cell al foams of ppi impregnate with silicone or epoxy resin the compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristic of ipc be also examine and compare the result show that although both ipc have a similar foam structure with similar density the disparity in the property of impregnated polymer lead to distinct mechanical property the combination of al foam and polymer both silicone and epoxyresin result in ipc stiff than either of the two individual material bythemselve high stiffness be find in ipc with epoxy resin owe to brittle nature of the resin energy absorption capacity be also increase when compare with the original al foam
104,Dynamic symmetry breaking in sat using augmented clauses with a polynomial-time lexicographic pruning,"© 2018 IEEE.Dynamic symmetry breaking in Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) is often performed by adding symmetric versions of the learned clauses into the clause database. Using a notion of augmented clause every symmetric version can be learned. The task of unit propagation is then transformed into a search problem under a permutation group. Our work focuses on a special kind of symmetry called row symmetry. We present the optimization to the search problem under a group containing row symmetry subgroups mainly relies on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instances can be reduced to minimal assignment problems. We also introduce a construction of subgroups of row symmetry groups to ensure that every sub-task could be performed in polynomial time. Lastly, we discuss the implementation of our technique and some of the technical issue that needed to be address.","['MATH', 'MATSCI']",dynamic symmetry break in sit use augmented clause with a polynomial time lexicographic pruning ieee dynamic symmetry break in boolean satisfiability problem sit be often perform by add symmetric version of the learn clause into the clause database use a notion of augmented clause every symmetric version can be learn the task of unit propagation be then transform into a search problem under a permutation group our work focus on a special kind of symmetry call row symmetry we present the optimization to the search problem under a group contain row symmetry subgroup mainly rely on lexicographic pruning and the fact that some instance can be reduce to minimal assignment problem we also introduce a construction of subgroup of row symmetry group to ensure that every sub task could be perform in polynomial time lastly we discuss the implementation of our technique and some of the technical issue that need to be address
105,A durable rechargeable zinc-air battery via self-supported MnOx-S air electrode,"© 2021 The Author(s)The durability and performance of an air electrode can have a crucial impact on rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). A typical air electrode fabricated using conductive carbon and a polymeric binder suffers rapid degradation during charging, stemming from oxygen bubbles erosion and carbon corrosion. This work presents a durable air electrode having a self-supported sulfur-doped manganese oxides (MnOx-S) electrocatalyst prepared through hydrothermal process followed by ambient temperature sulfurization. Upon sulfurization, MnO2 nanoflakes are transformed into MnOx-S having a heterostructure of Mn3O4, MnO2 and MnSx. MnOx-S provided superior electrochemical properties for both oxygen reduction reaction (Tafel slope of 68 mV/dec) and oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slope of 80 mV/dec). Self-supported electrodes using MnOx-S and MnO2 electrocatalysts were scrutinized in a bi-electrode rechargeable ZAB having a stagnant electrolyte. In the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode, both significant discharge peak power density (74 mW/cm2 at 135 mA/cm2) as well as low voltage difference between charge and discharge processes (0.75 V) were observed. In addition, for charge-discharge cycling at 20 mA/cm2, the ZAB using the self-supported MnOx-S electrode achieved stable cycling through 2000 cycles without apparent degradation. The air electrode having the self-supported MnOx-S paves the way for a more durable and higher performance favoring practical application for rechargeable ZABs.","['METAL', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATH']",a durable rechargeable zinc air battery via self support mnox s air electrode the author s the durability and performance of an air electrode can have a crucial impact on rechargeable zinc air battery zab a typical air electrode fabricate use conductive carbon and a polymeric binder suffer rapid degradation during charge stem from oxygen bubble erosion and carbon corrosion this work present a durable air electrode have a self support sulfur dope manganese oxides mnox s electrocatalyst prepare through hydrothermal process follow by ambient temperature sulfurization upon sulfurization mno nanoflake be transform into mnox s have a heterostructure of mn o mno and mnsx mnox s provide superior electrochemical property for both oxygen reduction reaction tafel slope of mv dec and oxygen evolution reaction tafel slope of mv dec self support electrode use mnox s and mno electrocatalyst be scrutinize in a bi electrode rechargeable zab have a stagnant electrolyte in the zab use the self support mnox s electrode both significant discharge peak power density mw cm at ma cm as well as low voltage difference between charge and discharge process v be observe in addition for charge discharge cycling at ma cm the zab use the self support mnox s electrode achieve stable cycling through cycle without apparent degradation the air electrode have the self support mnox s pave the way for a more durable and high performance favor practical application for rechargeable zab
106,Anisotropic robustness of talc particles after surface modifications probed by atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy,"© 2021 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesAs a versatile mineral, the crystalline hydrated magnesium silicate talcum, or talc, has been widely used in numerous industries from pharmaceutical formulations to composite material designs. Its efficient application as filler/additives incorporates the improvement in concomitant properties within materials, e.g., strength, which involves interactions between talc particles and aqueous/nonaqueous matrices. Successful property enhancement imposes ideal mixing and homogenous adhesion within a talc particle, but they are limited by the coexistence of face and edge surfaces of talc, which exhibit different level of hydrophobicity. Here, using atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy, we showed that although hydrophilic talc particles obtained from acid treatment or aminosilanization better adhered with materials representing a matrix, the anisotropic characters of the two surface types persisted. Conversely, the degree of talc's surface anisotropy reduced with the surface hydrophobization by aliphatic methylsilanization, but followed by the decrease in adhesion. With ten-fold difference in Hamaker constants of the probe/talc surface interacting pairs, we showed that the adhesions resulted from van der Waals interactions that suggested the influence of surface polarity. The insight from this work would provide grounds for strategies to modulate talc's adhesion, hydrophobicity and surface uniformity.","['PE', 'OPTIC', 'NANO', 'MATSCI']",anisotropic robustness of talc particle after surface modification probe by atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy chinese society of particuology and institute of process engineering chinese academy of sciencesas a versatile mineral the crystalline hydrated magnesium silicate talcum or talc have be widely use in numerous industry from pharmaceutical formulation to composite material design its efficient application as filler additive incorporate the improvement in concomitant property within material e g strength which involve interaction between talc particle and aqueous nonaqueous matrix successful property enhancement impose ideal mixing and homogenous adhesion within a talc particle but they be limit by the coexistence of face and edge surface of talc which exhibit different level of hydrophobicity here use atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy we show that although hydrophilic talc particle obtain from acid treatment or aminosilanization well adhere with material represent a matrix the anisotropic character of the two surface type persist conversely the degree of talc s surface anisotropy reduce with the surface hydrophobization by aliphatic methylsilanization but follow by the decrease in adhesion with ten fold difference in hamaker constant of the probe talc surface interact pair we show that the adhesion result from van der waal interaction that suggest the influence of surface polarity the insight from this work would provide ground for strategy to modulate talc s adhesion hydrophobicity and surface uniformity
107,Movie Revenue Prediction Using Regression and Clustering,"© 2018 IEEE.Among many movies that have been released, some generate high profit while the others do not. This paper studies the relationship between movie factors and its revenue and build prediction models. Besides analysis on aggregate data, we also divide data into groups using different methods and compare accuracy across these techniques as well as explore whether clustering techniques could help improve accuracy. Specifically, two major steps were employed. Initially, linear regression, polynomial regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied on the entire movie data to predict the movie revenue. Then, clustering techniques, such as by genre, using Expectation Maximization (EM) and using K-means were applied to divide data into groups before regression analyses are executed. To compare accuracy among different techniques, R-square and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used as a performance indicator. Our study shows that generally linear regression without clustering offers the model with the highest R-square, while linear regression with EM clustering yields the lowest RMSE.","['CPE', 'EDU', 'MATH']",movie revenue prediction use regression and cluster ieee among many movie that have be release some generate high profit while the other do not this paper study the relationship between movie factor and its revenue and build prediction model besides analysis on aggregate datum we also divide datum into group use different method and compare accuracy across these technique as well as explore whether clustering technique could help improve accuracy specifically two major step be employ initially linear regression polynomial regression and support vector regression svr be apply on the entire movie datum to predict the movie revenue then cluster technique such as by genre use expectation maximization em and use k mean be apply to divide datum into group before regression analysis be execute to compare accuracy among different technique r square and the root mean square error rmse be use as a performance indicator our study show that generally linear regression without clustering offer the model with the high r square while linear regression with em cluster yield the low rmse
108,Effect of different phase composition in titania on catalytic behaviors of AgLi/TiO2 catalysts via ethanol dehydrogenation,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.This research was to investigate the production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over AgLi/TiO2 catalysts containing different phases of TiO2 supports. The catalysts were prepared via impregnation of Ag and Li onto TiO2 having different phases [anatase (A), rutile (R) and mixed phases (AR)]. The structure of different AgLi/TiO2 catalysts was confirmed using various techniques including XRD, N2 physisorption, SEM-EDX, ICP, FTIR, UV-vis spectroscopy, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD. The results from non-oxidative dehydrogenation indicated that AgLi/TiO2-A catalyst exhibited the highest acetaldehyde yield of ca. 40 % at 300â°C, while acetaldehyde yield of ca. 66 % was obtained for AgLi/TiO2-AR catalyst at 300â°C in oxidative dehydrogenation. On the basis of experimental results, we conclude that the phases transition of TiO2 strongly affects the physicochemical properties of AgLi/TiO2 catalysts. The influence of catalyst properties such as the strength of basic sites and reduction behaviors have been a positive synergetic effect for enhancing the catalytic performance of both reactions.

110,Effect of sustained service loading on post-fire flexural response of reinforced concrete T-beams,"Copyright © 2019, American Concrete Institute. All rights reservedThis paper presents the effect of sustained service loading at elevated temperatures on the residual flexural response of reinforced concrete (RC) T-beams after exposed to elevated temperatures of 700 and 900°C (1292 and 1652°F) for 3 hours and then cooled in air. Two beams were subjected to a constant simulated service loading equal to 22.6% of undamaged (unheated) flexural strength, while the counterpart beams were exposed to fire without any applied sustained load. The test results showed that the bottom (tension) steel reinforcements in all fire-exposed beams had experienced the peak temperatures that were higher than a critical value (593°C [1099°F]) before the post-fire static test. The post-fire static test results showed that the sustained loading has a detrimental effect on the post-fire flexural response of RC beams. The effect was more pronounced on the post-fire stiffness and ductility than on strength. In the paper, simplified finite element models for predicting the temperature response and post-fire load-deflection relationships of fire-exposed RC beams are also described.","['CE', 'SAFETY', 'MATH']",effect of sustained service loading on post fire flexural response of reinforce concrete t beam copyright american concrete institute all right reservedthis paper present the effect of sustained service loading at elevate temperature on the residual flexural response of reinforce concrete rc t beam after expose to elevated temperature of and c and f for hour and then cool in air two beam be subject to a constant simulate service loading equal to of undamaged unheated flexural strength while the counterpart beam be expose to fire without any apply sustained load the test result show that the bottom tension steel reinforcement in all fire expose beam have experience the peak temperature that be high than a critical value c f before the post fire static test the post fire static test result show that the sustained loading have a detrimental effect on the post fire flexural response of rc beam the effect be more pronounced on the post fire stiffness and ductility than on strength in the paper simplify finite element model for predict the temperature response and post fire load deflection relationship of fire expose rc beam be also describe
111,Effect of acrylonitrile content of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber on mechanical and thermal properties of dynamically vulcanized poly(lactic acid) blends,"© 2019 Society of Chemical IndustryWe report here the morphology, thermal and tensile properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blends composed of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) with different acrylonitrile contents with/without dynamic vulcanization by dicumyl peroxide (DCP). The interfacial tension of PLA and NBR measured by contact angle measurement decreased as the acrylonitrile content of NBR decreased. Likewise, SEM images showed that the rubber particle size reduced with decreasing acrylonitrile content owing to the stronger interfacial adhesion between the PLA matrix and NBR domains. Incorporation of DCP at 1.0 phr for dynamic vulcanization led to higher crosslink density and, in turn, optimal tensile strength and tensile toughness as a result of the action of PLA-NBR copolymer as a reactive compatibilizer. The dynamic vulcanization of the blends containing low acrylonitrile NBR gave the most improved tensile properties because the free radicals from DCP decomposition preferentially attacked the allylic hydrogen atoms or double bonds of the butadiene backbone. Accordingly, more NBR macroradicals were generated and probably more PLA-NBR copolymers were produced. Moreover, further addition of DCP at 2.0 phr provided a large amount of crosslinked NBR gel, which significantly degraded the tensile properties. From the DSC results, dynamic vulcanization lowered the cold crystallization temperature, implying an improvement of cold crystallization. Finally, TGA results showed a higher degradation temperature as a function of DCP content, which suggested that thermal stability increased due to stronger interfacial adhesion as well as higher gel content. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","['CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",effect of acrylonitrile content of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber on mechanical and thermal property of dynamically vulcanize poly lactic acid blend society of chemical industrywe report here the morphology thermal and tensile property of poly lactic acid pla blend compose of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber nbr with different acrylonitrile content with without dynamic vulcanization by dicumyl peroxide dcp the interfacial tension of pla and nbr measure by contact angle measurement decrease as the acrylonitrile content of nbr decrease likewise sem image show that the rubber particle size reduce with decrease acrylonitrile content owe to the strong interfacial adhesion between the pla matrix and nbr domain incorporation of dcp at phr for dynamic vulcanization lead to high crosslink density and in turn optimal tensile strength and tensile toughness as a result of the action of pla nbr copolymer as a reactive compatibilizer the dynamic vulcanization of the blend contain low acrylonitrile nbr give the most improved tensile property because the free radical from dcp decomposition preferentially attack the allylic hydrogen atom or double bond of the butadiene backbone accordingly more nbr macroradical be generate and probably more pla nbr copolymer be produce moreover further addition of dcp at phr provide a large amount of crosslinked nbr gel which significantly degrade the tensile property from the dsc result dynamic vulcanization lower the cold crystallization temperature imply an improvement of cold crystallization finally tga result show a high degradation temperature as a function of dcp content which suggest that thermal stability increase due to strong interfacial adhesion as well as high gel content society of chemical industry
112,Carbon Dioxide Adsorption on Grafted Nanofibrous Adsorbents Functionalized Using Different Amines,"© Copyright © 2019 Abbasi, Nasef, Babadi, Faridi-Majidi, Takeshi, Abouzari-Lotf, Choong, Somwangthanaroj and Kheawhom.Of late, the demand for new CO2 adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and stability is growing very fast. Nanofibrous adsorbents are potential materials for such application with most attempts made on carbon nanofibers. In this study, a series of electrospun nanofibrous adsorbents containing amines were prepared using a 3-stage promising approach and tested comparatively for CO2 capture. The preparation of adsorbents involved electrospinning of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) solution, radiation-induced grafting (RIG) of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) onto electrospun nanofibers, and functionalization of poly-GMA grafted s-PP nanofibrous mats with different amines, including ethanolamine (EA) diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA). The effect of different amination parameters: namely, amine concentration, reaction time, temperature, and degree of grafting (DG) on the degree of amination (DA), was evaluated. The nanofibrous mats containing amine were tested for CO2 adsorption in a fixed bed column operated under various parameters such as amine density, amine type, initial CO2 concentration and temperature. The adsorbents recorded CO2 adsorption capacities of 2.87, 2.06, and 0.94 mmol/g for EA-, DEA- and TEA-containing adsorbents, respectively, at 30°C using initial CO2 concentration of 15%. This was coupled with the same order of high amine efficiency of 75, 57, and 31%. Results demonstrated that the nanofibrous adsorbent containing amine had strong potential for CO2 capture application.","['NANO', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",carbon dioxide adsorption on graft nanofibrous adsorbent functionalize use different amine copyright abbasi nasef babadi faridi majidi takeshi abouzari lotf choong somwangthanaroj and kheawhom of late the demand for new co adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and stability be grow very fast nanofibrous adsorbent be potential material for such application with most attempt make on carbon nanofiber in this study a series of electrospun nanofibrous adsorbent contain amine be prepare use a stage promise approach and test comparatively for co capture the preparation of adsorbent involve electrospinne of syndiotactic polypropylene s pp solution radiation induce grafting rig of glycidyl methacrylate gma onto electrospun nanofiber and functionalization of poly gma graft s pp nanofibrous mat with different amine include ethanolamine ea diethylamine dea and triethylamine tea the effect of different amination parameter namely amine concentration reaction time temperature and degree of graft dg on the degree of amination da be evaluate the nanofibrous mat contain amine be test for co adsorption in a fix bed column operate under various parameter such as amine density amine type initial co concentration and temperature the adsorbent record co adsorption capacity of and mmol g for ea dea and tea contain adsorbent respectively at c use initial co concentration of this be couple with the same order of high amine efficiency of and result demonstrate that the nanofibrous adsorbent contain amine have strong potential for co capture application

This paper is shown that the dynamic parameters in the traction controller can be negligible in some cases, internal sensor state variables and gain parameters are enough to retain some traction controllability. The controller is derived from the model following control method (MFC) on a discrete domain. Experiments are performed, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the simplified controller using a two-wheeled mobile robot, by comparing slippage between the position and velocity control scheme with and without the traction control scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed traction control scheme is able to suppress the slip and very simple to implement.","['CPE', 'MATSCI']",simple discrete time traction control for a two wheel mobile robot publish under licence by iop publish ltd traction control usually need dynamic parameter as an approximated reference in the model such as inertia and friction or heavily computational estimator such as slip ratio estimator and friction estimator this paper be show that the dynamic parameter in the traction controller can be negligible in some case internal sensor state variable and gain parameter be enough to retain some traction controllability the controller be derive from the model follow control method mfc on a discrete domain experiment be perform in order to evaluate the efficiency of the simplified controller use a two wheel mobile robot by compare slippage between the position and velocity control scheme with and without the traction control scheme the experimental result show that the propose traction control scheme be able to suppress the slip and very simple to implement

Nowadays, installing the rooftop solar PV can help reduce overall electricity bill of the owner throughout the lifetime of the system. However, in some countries including Thailand, selling large amount of power output from the rooftop solar PV to the grid may not be allowed, due to the strict grid code. At present, price of battery is continuously decreasing. Consequently, installation of the rooftop solar PV with battery might solve this problem. Thus, this paper proposes a method to determine the optimal installed capacity of rooftop solar PV generation and the minimum required size of the battery which improve the cost-benefit from installing solar power generation without the battery.","['ME', 'EE', 'IE']",benefit and cost analysis of the installation of rooftop solar pv with battery system ieeeover the last few year rooftop solar pv system receive high interest due to its rapid cost reduction nowadays instal the rooftop solar pv can help reduce overall electricity bill of the owner throughout the lifetime of the system however in some country include thailand sell large amount of power output from the rooftop solar pv to the grid may not be allow due to the strict grid code at present price of battery be continuously decrease consequently installation of the rooftop solar pv with battery might solve this problem thus this paper propose a method to determine the optimal instal capacity of rooftop solar pv generation and the minimum require size of the battery which improve the cost benefit from instal solar power generation without the battery

118,Traffic prediction using attentional spatial-temporal deep learning with accident embedding,"© 2019 IEEE.Nowadays, an intelligent transportation system (ITS) is extremely important. High accuracy traffic prediction has been studied in large-scale networks. Deep learning methods are able to analyze the complex, multi-dimensional data to provide the least traffic prediction error. Both spatial and temporal dependencies provide significant implications for traffic prediction. Hence, we propose a combination of deep learning method architectures which consist of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze spatial and temporal features and predict traffic speed in multiple steps. An accident has a major impact on local traffic congestion. We employ an autoencoder with a monotonic attention mechanism to learn accident embedding input to detect unexpected accidents and their effects. An experiment was conducted on two datasets of Highways England and Thai Expressways. Results showed that spatial and temporal features can solve problems at different locations in the traffic network using the deep learning method to improve traffic prediction performance. Furthermore, a monotonic attention mechanism using an autoencoder to learn how accidents impact on traffic congestion can minimize the prediction error.","['BME', 'EE', 'CPE', 'SAFETY']",traffic prediction use attentional spatial temporal deep learning with accident embed ieee nowadays an intelligent transportation system its be extremely important high accuracy traffic prediction have be study in large scale network deep learning method be able to analyze the complex multi dimensional datum to provide the least traffic prediction error both spatial and temporal dependency provide significant implication for traffic prediction hence we propose a combination of deep learning method architecture which consist of convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm to analyze spatial and temporal feature and predict traffic speed in multiple step an accident have a major impact on local traffic congestion we employ an autoencoder with a monotonic attention mechanism to learn accident embed input to detect unexpected accident and their effect an experiment be conduct on two dataset of highway england and thai expressway result show that spatial and temporal feature can solve problem at different location in the traffic network use the deep learning method to improve traffic prediction performance furthermore a monotonic attention mechanism use an autoencoder to learn how accident impact on traffic congestion can minimize the prediction error
119,Deposition of Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 by pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering for selective hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (PDC-MSD) was employed for the deposition of Pt nanoparticles (ca. 0.1 wt.%) on anatase TiO2 powder. According to the H2-TPR, XPS, and TEM-EDX results, the characteristics and properties of the deposited nanoparticles depended on the deposition time. During the initial deposition stage (45–90 sec), low-coordinated small spherical Pt nanoparticles were formed. Prolonging the deposition time (135–180 sec), led to the formation of larger Pt nanoparticles, which strongly interacted with the TiO2. The catalytic activities of the prepared Pt/TiO2 with different deposition times in the aqueous phase partial hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol ranged as follows: Pt/TiO2 MSD-45 < Pt/TiO2MSD-90 < Pt/TiO2MSD-180 < Pt/TiO2 MSD-135, which was in good agreement with the atomic Pt/Ti ratio and coordinated surface Pt atoms on the catalyst surface. The high catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2 MSD-135 was attributed to the presence of well-dispersed small Pt nanoparticles with more highly-coordinated Pt surface atoms deposited on the TiO2 anatase. PDC-MSD has been proven to be a more effective method for the preparation of supported metal catalysts, compared to those obtained by conventional impregnation technique.","['PE', 'METAL', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",deposition of pt nanoparticle on tio by pulse direct current magnetron sputter for selective hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol elsevi b v pulse direct current magnetron sputter pdc msd be employ for the deposition of pt nanoparticle can wt on anatase tio powder accord to the h tpr xps and tem edx result the characteristic and property of the deposit nanoparticle depend on the deposition time during the initial deposition stage sec low coordinate small spherical pt nanoparticle be form prolong the deposition time sec lead to the formation of large pt nanoparticle which strongly interact with the tio the catalytic activity of the prepared pt tio with different deposition time in the aqueous phase partial hydrogenation of vanillin to vanillyl alcohol range as follow pt tio msd pt tio msd pt tio msd pt tio msd which be in good agreement with the atomic pt ti ratio and coordinated surface pt atom on the catalyst surface the high catalytic activity of pt tio msd be attribute to the presence of well disperse small pt nanoparticle with more highly coordinated pt surface atom deposit on the tio anatase pdc msd have be prove to be a more effective method for the preparation of support metal catalyst compare to those obtain by conventional impregnation technique

The governing equation of the bulk is formulated from the classical linear elasticity theory via a SBFE technique whereas that of the material surface is obtained from a complete version of Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory. By enforcing the continuity at the interface of the material surface and the bulk, it leads to a system of linear non-homogenous ordinary differential equations governing the nodal functions. A general solution of the resulting system of ODEs is constructed via standard procedures and then used together with the boundary conditions to form a system of linear algebraic equations governing nodal degrees of freedom. To investigate the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method, selected scenarios are solved and obtained numerical results are reported and discussed.","['NANO', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",sbfe analysis of nano scale elastic layer with consideration of surface energy effect publish under licence by iop publish ltd this paper present an efficient and accurate numerical technique for determine the mechanical response of an infinite elastic layer under surface loading and surface stress effect the govern equation of the bulk be formulate from the classical linear elasticity theory via a sbfe technique whereas that of the material surface be obtain from a complete version of gurtin murdoch surface elasticity theory by enforce the continuity at the interface of the material surface and the bulk it lead to a system of linear non homogenous ordinary differential equation govern the nodal function a general solution of the result system of ode be construct via standard procedure and then use together with the boundary condition to form a system of linear algebraic equation govern nodal degree of freedom to investigate the accuracy and convergence of the propose method select scenario be solve and obtain numerical result be report and discuss

Especially, small devices like smartphones are widely used due to the greater mobility and connectivity. A majority of organizations provide the wireless local area network which is necessary for small devices and business data transmission. The resources access through Wi-Fi network of the organization needs intense restriction. WPA2 Enterprise with 802.1X standard is typically introduced to handle user authentication on the network using the EAP framework. However, credentials management for all users is a hassle for administrators. Strong authentication provides higher security whereas the difficulty of deployment is still open issues. This research proposes the utility of Near Field Communication to securely transmit certificate data that rely on the hybrid cryptosystem. The approach supports enterprise Wi-Fi hotspot authentication based on WPA2-802.1X model with the EAP-TLS method. It also applies multi-factor authentication for enhancing the security of networks and users.

124,Treatment of produced water mixed with polymer from petroleum production,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In the petroleum industry, polymer flooding is one of the main methods in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that applies a water-soluble polymer such as partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) to increase oil production. It is added to the flooding water to improve the oil movement. During the process, water is produced as a by-product along with oil and gas production. Moreover, produced water with polymer is more difficult to treat than that from conventional water-flooding process because it is complex and highly contaminated wastewater. The proper technology is required to treat this kind of wastewater and reuse it for oil production. Furthermore, the small to fine particles in the produced are needed to be removed because these particles can plug the reservoir in the oilfield. One of the main treatment processes is to apply the coagulant to agglomerate the fine particles and remove them before injection the water into the reservoir. Therefore, the objective of this study is to treat the produced water mixed with HPAM from petroleum production by using coagulants like polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and to investigate the effect of parameters such as coagulant dosage and polymer concentration on the treatment of produced water. The results are compared the performance with the conventional coagulant, potassium aluminum sulfate (potassium alum). The operating parameters of this study are coagulant dosage ranging from 300 to 900 mg/L and HPAM concentrations from 500 to 2,000 mg/L. In addition, the turbidity, as well as total suspended solids (TSS) are also studied. The results indicated that with an increase in HPAM concentration, the TSS and turbidity increase gradually under the same conditions. The results show that with 900 mg/L of coagulants, TSS and turbidity can be removed up to 89% and 94% with PAC and 39% and 27% with potassium alum, respectively. PAC can provide higher performance over alum at the same conditions; thus, leading to the reduction in chemical consumption and cost. Consequently, this method can be applied to use in the wastewater treatment from oil production with polymer flooding before injecting this produced water back into the reservoir.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'OPTIC', 'CHE', 'MATENG']",treatment of produce water mix with polymer from petroleum production publish under licence by iop publish ltd in the petroleum industry polymer flooding be one of the main method in enhance oil recovery eor that apply a water soluble polymer such as partially hydrolyze polyacrylamide hpam to increase oil production it be add to the flooding water to improve the oil movement during the process water be produce as a by product along with oil and gas production moreover produce water with polymer be more difficult to treat than that from conventional water flooding process because it be complex and highly contaminate wastewater the proper technology be require to treat this kind of wastewater and reuse it for oil production furthermore the small to fine particle in the produce be need to be remove because these particle can plug the reservoir in the oilfield one of the main treatment process be to apply the coagulant to agglomerate the fine particle and remove they before injection the water into the reservoir therefore the objective of this study be to treat the produce water mix with hpam from petroleum production by use coagulant like polyaluminium chloride pac and to investigate the effect of parameter such as coagulant dosage and polymer concentration on the treatment of produce water the result be compare the performance with the conventional coagulant potassium aluminum sulfate potassium alum the operate parameter of this study be coagulant dosage range from to mg l and hpam concentration from to mg l in addition the turbidity as well as total suspend solid tss be also study the result indicate that with an increase in hpam concentration the tss and turbidity increase gradually under the same condition the result show that with mg l of coagulant tss and turbidity can be remove up to and with pac and and with potassium alum respectively pac can provide high performance over alum at the same condition thus lead to the reduction in chemical consumption and cost consequently this method can be apply to use in the wastewater treatment from oil production with polymer flooding before inject this produce water back into the reservoir

126,An enhanced time series classification using linear-regression based shape descriptor,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.Time series classification (TSC) has been used extensively with a wide range in many fields of real-world applications. Nearest Neighbor (NN) with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is regarded as one of the most effective and popular method used for a time series classification problem. Being a non-linear-alignment distance measure, DTW is known to function harmoniously with NN classifier as an effective tool in matching two time series sequences. However, despite the fact that DTW is specifically designed to discover an optimal alignment, it may not be able to achieve sensible local alignment. In this work, the shapeDTW framework was adopted in order to classify time series data based on the state-of-the-art HOG1D shape descriptor. Point-wise local structures were utilized in the alignment process; similarly-shaped structures are matched based on their levels of similarity. A generic alignment framework was provided by shapeDTW, which allows users to design the shape descriptors based on the data characteristics and domains. An enhanced shape descriptor representation called HOG1D-L was proposed based on two key concepts of the state-of-the-art HOG1D descriptor and linear regression. The proposed work on 84 UCR time series datasets was extensively tested and the results demonstrate that our approach can maintain or achieve better classification accuracy in most of the datasets.","['EE', 'MATH']",an enhance time series classification use linear regression base shape descriptor association for compute machinery time series classification tsc have be use extensively with a wide range in many field of real world application nearest neighbor nn with dynamic time warp dtw be regard as one of the most effective and popular method use for a time series classification problem be a non linear alignment distance measure dtw be know to function harmoniously with nn classifier as an effective tool in match two time series sequence however despite the fact that dtw be specifically design to discover an optimal alignment it may not be able to achieve sensible local alignment in this work the shapedtw framework be adopt in order to classify time series datum base on the state of the art hog d shape descriptor point wise local structure be utilize in the alignment process similarly shape structure be match base on their level of similarity a generic alignment framework be provide by shapedtw which allow user to design the shape descriptor base on the datum characteristic and domain an enhanced shape descriptor representation call hog d l be propose base on two key concept of the state of the art hog d descriptor and linear regression the propose work on ucr time series dataset be extensively test and the result demonstrate that our approach can maintain or achieve well classification accuracy in most of the dataset
127,Ethanol Dehydration over WO3/TiO2 Catalysts Using Titania Derived from Sol-Gel and Solvothermal Methods,"© 2019 Anchale Tresatayawed et al.The present study aims to investigate the catalytic ethanol dehydration to higher value products including ethylene, diethyl ether (DEE), and acetaldehyde. The catalysts used for this reaction were WO3/TiO2 catalysts having W loading of 13.5 wt.%. For a comparative study, the TiO2 supports employed were varied by two different preparation methods including the sol-gel and solvothermal-derived TiO2 supports, denoted as TiO2-SG and TiO2-SV, respectively. It is obvious that the different preparation methods essentially altered the physicochemical properties of TiO2 supports. It was found that the TiO2-SV exhibited higher surface area and pore volume and larger amounts of acid sites than those of TiO2-SG. As a consequence, different characteristics of support apparently affected the catalytic properties of WO3/TiO2 catalysts. As expected, both catalysts WO3/TiO2-SG and WO3/TiO2-SV exhibited increased ethanol conversion with increasing temperatures from 200 to 400°C. It appeared that the highest ethanol conversion (ca. 88%) at 400°C was achieved by the WO3/TiO2-SV catalysts due to its high acidity. It is worth noting that the presence of WO3 onto TiO2-SV yielded a remarkable increase in DEE selectivity (ca. 68%) at 250°C. In summary, WO3/TiO2-SV catalyst is promising to convert ethanol into ethylene and DEE, having the highest ethylene yield of ca. 77% at 400°C and highest DEE yield of ca. 26% at 250°C.

In other words, to reach the optimal performance, the effective operation of FO process can be achieved by working on these optimal design parameters. In this work, to simulate the influence of each initial condition on FO process performance, sensitivity analysis technique was introduced to developed dynamic FO model, focused on both single and a mixture of two organic acid feed solutions, by NH4Cl as draw solution. As functions of operating variables, the FO membrane rejection and concentration performance of the system could precisely be defined via Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The simulation results demonstrated that sensitivity analysis techniques can be practically applied as a guideline to design and modify any comparable FO processes by optimizing operating parameters to achieve the desirable performance in terms of both minimizing cost and maximizing efficiency.","['CHE', 'IE', 'MATH']",sensitivity analysis technique for the optimal system design of forward osmosis in organic acid recovery elsevi ltdas the critical parameter the operating condition be able to define the system efficiency of forward osmosis fo process in other word to reach the optimal performance the effective operation of fo process can be achieve by work on these optimal design parameter in this work to simulate the influence of each initial condition on fo process performance sensitivity analysis technique be introduce to develop dynamic fo model focus on both single and a mixture of two organic acid feed solution by nh cl as draw solution as function of operating variable the fo membrane rejection and concentration performance of the system could precisely be define via levenberg marquardt algorithm the simulation result demonstrate that sensitivity analysis technique can be practically apply as a guideline to design and modify any comparable fo process by optimize operate parameter to achieve the desirable performance in term of both minimize cost and maximize efficiency
129,"Effects of framing on earthquake risk perception in Chiang Rai, Thailand","© 2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.The effects of framing are important to the perception of earthquake risk. This research investigated the effects of framing on the people’s perception of earthquake risk in Chiang Rai, Thailand. There were three frames conveying the same earthquake risk but presented in different terms. These statements were in frequency terms of building damage: 475 severely damaged private buildings in 500 years, 10% chance of occurrence in 50 years, and one severely damaged private building per year. The objective of this research was to determine whether framing the same earthquake risk in different terms led to different perceptions of the risk by different people, leading to 1. what would be the most effective framing type regarding severely damaged private buildings, 2. which affected people’s earthquake risk perception most, and 3. whether experiencing an earthquake disaster would change the risk perception of the residents. The result showed that presenting the risk as “one severely damaged private building per year” was the most commonly selected among the three frames and was statistically significant. This finding clarifies that short time frames influence people’s earthquake risk decisions, and agencies can effectively use framing to communicate the earthquake risk to people in seismic regions to stimulate their earthquake preparedness and to reduce future earthquake risk. However, earthquake experience does not change the risk perception of the residents.","['CE', 'PE', 'EE', 'SAFETY']",effect of frame on earthquake risk perception in chiang rai thailand fuji technology press all right reserve the effect of framing be important to the perception of earthquake risk this research investigate the effect of frame on the people s perception of earthquake risk in chiang rai thailand there be three frame convey the same earthquake risk but present in different term these statement be in frequency term of build damage severely damage private building in year chance of occurrence in year and one severely damage private building per year the objective of this research be to determine whether frame the same earthquake risk in different term lead to different perception of the risk by different people lead to what would be the most effective framing type regard severely damage private building which affect people s earthquake risk perception most and whether experience an earthquake disaster would change the risk perception of the resident the result show that present the risk as one severely damage private building per year be the most commonly select among the three frame and be statistically significant this finding clarifie that short time frame influence people s earthquake risk decision and agency can effectively use frame to communicate the earthquake risk to people in seismic region to stimulate their earthquake preparedness and to reduce future earthquake risk however earthquake experience do not change the risk perception of the resident
130,Forecasting International Tourist Arrivals from Major Countries to Thailand,"© 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Tourism industry is one of the most important industries for Thai economy. This paper proposes and compares forecasting models for international tourism arrivals to Thailand. Since country-specific forecasting models can reflect the uniqueness of each country of origin, major countries for Thai tourism, namely China, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, and Russia are explored. The data used in this research is the number of international tourist arrivals from those countries recorded monthly from Jan 2013 to Sep 2018. The performance of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA) and the multiple regression model are evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Several important economic factors such as income, price, exchange rate, and qualitative factors, represented by dummy variables of seasonal effect are explored to understand their effects on international tourism demand. The results show that the SARIMA is preferred to forecast international tourism arrivals from Malaysia, while multiple regression provides lowest errors for other interested countries.","['IE', 'MATH']",forecast international tourist arrival from major country to thailand springer nature singapore pte ltd tourism industry be one of the most important industry for thai economy this paper propose and compare forecasting model for international tourism arrival to thailand since country specific forecasting model can reflect the uniqueness of each country of origin major country for thai tourism namely china malaysia korea japan and russia be explore the datum use in this research be the number of international tourist arrival from those country record monthly from jan to sep the performance of the seasonal autoregressive integrate move average model sarima and the multiple regression model be evaluate in term of mean absolute percentage error mape several important economic factor such as income price exchange rate and qualitative factor represent by dummy variable of seasonal effect be explore to understand their effect on international tourism demand the result show that the sarima be prefer to forecast international tourism arrival from malaysia while multiple regression provide low error for other interested country

The catalyst was pretreated with different gas including air, nitrogen, and hydrogen. It was tested in ethanol dehydration in the presence and absence of oxygen cofeeding. It was significantly found that with the presence of oxygen cofeeding, the complete ethanol conversion was obtained at very low temperature (ca. 200 °C) and ethylene was a major product. This can be attributed to increased moderate and strong acid sites of catalyst by oxygen cofeeding. In addition, the different gas pretreatment seemed to have less effect on catalytic behaviors.","['ME', 'CHE']",tune of catalytic behavior in ethanol dehydration with oxygen cofeede over pd hbz catalyst for ethylene production at low temperature elsevi b v the catalytic ethanol dehydration with oxygen cofeede over different pretreated pd hbz catalyst be investigate the catalyst be pretreate with different gas include air nitrogen and hydrogen it be test in ethanol dehydration in the presence and absence of oxygen cofeede it be significantly find that with the presence of oxygen cofeede the complete ethanol conversion be obtain at very low temperature can c and ethylene be a major product this can be attribute to increase moderate and strong acid site of catalyst by oxygen cofeede in addition the different gas pretreatment seem to have less effect on catalytic behavior
132,Online Emerging Topic Detection on Twitter Using Random Forest with Stock Indicator Features,"© 2018 IEEE.Social media is one of the most impactful and fastest communication methods. By monitoring Twitter streams, we are able to detect emerging topics and understand events around the world. There are some prior attempts that aim to online detect topics on Twitter. However, they can only detect bursty topics by using user-defined keywords a long with simple rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect emerging topics on Twitter streams. To detect emerging topics, a clustering technique has been applied to aggregate a set of keywords. Since an emerging topic occurs continuously, the emerging topics are merged with stateful technique to accumulate topics from different time intervals. To detect both high signal topics and small-medium signal topics, we use statistical features based on average, acceleration, and z-score. Moreover, we propose to include the stock indicator features: Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (STOCH). They are common features in trend (oversold and overbought) detection in stock analysis which is similar to our topic detection in twitter. To capture any event patterns, Random Forest (RF) has been proposed as a classifier to detect emerging keywords by utilizing the stated above five features. To evaluate the performance, we created and published a corpus by collecting Twitter data for 10 days with over 80 million tweets and then labeling possible topics in tota1161 events along with related keywords. The experiment was conducted on our collected data. The Fl-results show that our model outperforms all baselines: TwitterMonitor, SigniTrend, and TopicSketch, in terms of detected keywords and topics.","['EE', 'CPE']",online emerge topic detection on twitter use random forest with stock indicator feature ieee social medium be one of the most impactful and fast communication method by monitor twitter stream we be able to detect emerge topic and understand event around the world there be some prior attempt that aim to online detect topic on twitter however they can only detect bursty topic by use user define keyword a long with simple rule in this paper we propose an algorithm to detect emerge topic on twitter stream to detect emerge topic a cluster technique have be apply to aggregate a set of keyword since an emerge topic occur continuously the emerge topic be merge with stateful technique to accumulate topic from different time interval to detect both high signal topic and small medium signal topic we use statistical feature base on average acceleration and z score moreover we propose to include the stock indicator feature relative strength index rsi and stochastic oscillator stoch they be common feature in trend oversell and overbought detection in stock analysis which be similar to our topic detection in twitter to capture any event pattern random forest rf have be propose as a classifier to detect emerge keyword by utilize the state above five feature to evaluate the performance we create and publish a corpus by collect twitter datum for day with over million tweet and then label possible topic in tota event along with related keyword the experiment be conduct on our collect datum the fl result show that our model outperform all baseline twittermonitor signitrend and topicsketch in term of detect keyword and topic

134,An investigation of saturated vapor pressure regarding low-volatility organophosphorus extractants Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid and tributyl phosphate: Correlation and thermodynamics study,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdNew saturated vapor pressure (psat) data of organophosphorus extractants, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and tributyl phosphate (TBP), were investigated in T = (383.8–546.2) K and psat = (0.13–6.67) kPa using vacuum distillation method. The data was found to be a good fit with Antoine, August, Riedel and Wagner equation. Regression constants prove to be very useful in estimating psat at operating temperature. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding affected D2EHPA having lower psat in comparison with TBP. Thermodynamic properties of both molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization were obtained using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. As temperature increased, molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization decreased showing a positive deviation from Trouton's rule. Using the relations of molar enthalpy and temperature, saturated liquid heat capacity was obtained. All data can be usefully employed for the design of a distillation column or evaporator for recycling of both extractants from organic wastewater.","['ENV', 'ME', 'CHE']",an investigation of saturate vapor pressure regard low volatility organophosphorus extractants di ethylhexyl phosphoric acid and tributyl phosphate correlation and thermodynamic study elsevi ltdnew saturate vapor pressure psat datum of organophosphorus extractant di ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d ehpa and tributyl phosphate tbp be investigate in t k and psat kpa use vacuum distillation method the datum be find to be a good fit with antoine august riedel and wagner equation regression constant prove to be very useful in estimate psat at operate temperature intermolecular hydrogen bonding affect d ehpa have low psat in comparison with tbp thermodynamic property of both molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization be obtain use the clausius clapeyron equation as temperature increase molar enthalpy and molar entropy of vaporization decrease show a positive deviation from trouton s rule use the relation of molar enthalpy and temperature saturate liquid heat capacity be obtain all datum can be usefully employ for the design of a distillation column or evaporator for recycling of both extractant from organic wastewater
135,Forecasting Thailand's Precipitation with Cascading Model of CNN and GRU,"© 2019 IEEE.Precipitation prediction is necessary to use in water management, especially in Thailand, it can be applied for various ways, such as flood warning, agriculture planning, etc. There are many prior attempts to forecast rainfall from the rain-gauge station. Some deployed traditional machine learning approaches: ARIMA, k-NN, etc. Recently, deep learning approach has shown promising results in this task. However, the accuracy is still limited since the raining period throughout the year in Thailand is very scarce, so most rainfall amount is zero. In this paper, we propose to cascade two deep learning networks to tackle this problem: one is a classification model to classify whether it rains or not, and the other is a regression model to predict rainfall amount. Our network is a combination of CNN and GRU, where CNN aims to capture relationship between various sensors and GRU aims to capture time-series information. Furthermore, we also perform multi-step forecasting by applying a rolling mechanism that uses the predicted rainfall and involved features to predict the next 6 steps. The experiment was conducted on hourly rainfall dataset for 6 years (2013-2018) provided from the public government sector in Thailand. We use RMSE as performance metric to evaluate three periods of rainfall: Overall, Rain, and non-rain periods and the results show that our cascading model is the winner with only 4.53% in term of RMSE which is the average percentage of difference from over all regions.","['ENV', 'EE', 'MATH']",forecast thailand s precipitation with cascade model of cnn and gru ieee precipitation prediction be necessary to use in water management especially in thailand it can be apply for various way such as flood warning agriculture planning etc there be many prior attempt to forecast rainfall from the rain gauge station some deploy traditional machine learn approach arima k nn etc recently deep learning approach have show promising result in this task however the accuracy be still limit since the raining period throughout the year in thailand be very scarce so most rainfall amount be zero in this paper we propose to cascade two deep learn network to tackle this problem one be a classification model to classify whether it rain or not and the other be a regression model to predict rainfall amount our network be a combination of cnn and gru where cnn aim to capture relationship between various sensor and gru aim to capture time series information furthermore we also perform multi step forecasting by apply a rolling mechanism that use the predict rainfall and involve feature to predict the next step the experiment be conduct on hourly rainfall dataset for year provide from the public government sector in thailand we use rmse as performance metric to evaluate three period of rainfall overall rain and non rain period and the result show that our cascade model be the winner with only in term of rmse which be the average percentage of difference from over all region

All rights reserved.Industrialization alongside urbanization is proceeding rapidly in worldwide that tend to generate massive greenhouse gas emissions. The conflict among rapid urbanization and sustainable development will become increasingly serious. Moreover, the current model of urbanization looks unsustainable for transition to a low-carbon city. Ecotourism is one of the sustainable development approach for tourism city to achieve the low carbon city target. This concept provides many benefits to the environment, economies and local people, especially in developing countries in ASEAN, such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Nan Province has been a popular tourist destination in Thailand over the past few years. Nan aimed to develop province to be ecotourism city and promoting sustainable natural resource management and conservation. This province risks failing to meet ecotourism target due to a rapid growth of tourism. In order to minimize the risks of ecotourism development in Nan, scenario planning was selected as an important tool to help Nan province to prepare and plan for the future development. Four scenarios were designed to present plausible alternative futures of Nan under particular assumption of key drivers and important uncertainties. STEEP analysis was selected to identify the key driving forces to include within the scenarios. In addition, the indicators for monitoring development of low carbon tourism city were also proposed.","['ENV', 'IE', 'SAFETY']",scenario plan for low carbon tourism city a case study of nan copyright elsevi ltd all right reserve industrialization alongside urbanization be proceed rapidly in worldwide that tend to generate massive greenhouse gas emission the conflict among rapid urbanization and sustainable development will become increasingly serious moreover the current model of urbanization look unsustainable for transition to a low carbon city ecotourism be one of the sustainable development approach for tourism city to achieve the low carbon city target this concept provide many benefit to the environment economy and local people especially in develop country in asean such as cambodia laos vietnam malaysia indonesia and thailand nan province have be a popular tourist destination in thailand over the past few year nan aim to develop province to be ecotourism city and promote sustainable natural resource management and conservation this province risk fail to meet ecotourism target due to a rapid growth of tourism in order to minimize the risk of ecotourism development in nan scenario planning be select as an important tool to help nan province to prepare and plan for the future development four scenario be design to present plausible alternative future of nan under particular assumption of key driver and important uncertainty steep analysis be select to identify the key drive force to include within the scenario in addition the indicator for monitor development of low carbon tourism city be also propose

In catchments where flow data are not recorded or of poor quality, hydrological indices could be an alternative for predicting flow in ungauged catchments. This study demonstrates the methodology for predicting flow in ungauged catchments through the case study of 37 sub-catchments of the upper Ping catchment in northwest Thailand from 2006-2014. The regression method was applied to investigate the relationship between three flow indices including runoff coefficient, base flow index, and 95th percentile of flow, and catchment properties. The prediction interval of the regression relationship was used to condition rainfall-runoff model parameters. The model performance was tested by NSE∗ and reliability. The 95th percentile of flow was found to be the most informative index to regionalize flow followed by RC. The BFI had least contribution to the prediction of flow with poor NSE∗ and large uncertainty. The 95th percentile of flow and RC generally worked well for small sub-catchments.","['ENV', 'MATH']",a development of a prediction model for ungauge catchment in the north of thailand association for compute machinery flow datum be essential for hydrological study planning and management to prevent drought and flood in a region in catchment where flow datum be not record or of poor quality hydrological index could be an alternative for predict flow in ungauge catchment this study demonstrate the methodology for predict flow in ungauge catchment through the case study of sub catchment of the upper ping catchment in northwest thailand from the regression method be apply to investigate the relationship between three flow index include runoff coefficient base flow index and th percentile of flow and catchment property the prediction interval of the regression relationship be use to condition rainfall runoff model parameter the model performance be test by nse and reliability the th percentile of flow be find to be the most informative index to regionalize flow follow by rc the bfi have least contribution to the prediction of flow with poor nse and large uncertainty the th percentile of flow and rc generally work well for small sub catchment
141,Surface-Dependence of Adsorption and Its Influence on Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Reaction: A Case of Photocatalytic Degradation of Linuron on Zinc Oxide,"© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: This work systematically investigates a discrepancy in photocatalytic degradation pathway observed even when same kind of photocatalyst is used. This issue is particularly important for the degradation of toxic compound because the shifting in the pathway may result in intermediates having increased toxicity. Linuron, which is a toxic herbicide, is used as a model compound and zinc oxide (ZnO) is used as a catalyst. Two forms of ZnO having different exposing surfaces, i.e., conventional particles and nanorods are considered. It is experimentally shown and confirmed by molecular simulation that the adsorption and subsequent degradation are surface dependent. The adsorption capacity of linuron on polar surfaces of ZnO is much higher than that on non-polar surface. More importantly, alignments of linuron molecule adsorbing on different surfaces are different, leading to formation of different degradation intermediates. The degradation takes place on both aliphatic and aromatic sides when linuron adsorbs on polar surfaces whereas only the aliphatic part is attacked by hydroxyl radicals on the non-polar mixed terminated surface. The results in this work indicate that the exposing surface of the photocatalyst is the key factor in determining the degradation pathway and it should be considered in the catalyst design.

143,Scaling Network Traffic Logger with Microservice Architecture,"© 2018 IEEE.Over the past few years, many large organizations evolve their technology stack to Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture. Although the traditional monolithic architecture is still a good choice for many applications, it does have limitations in scalability. A change made to a small part of the application also requires the entire monolith to be rebuilt and deployed. This makes it harder to maintain a good modular structure over time. This paper thus presents a design of network traffic logger using the microservice architecture. Based on the scaling model, scale cube, each service can be individually scaled, with the result being that the application is scaled more efficiently.

145,Foliage houseplant responses to low formaldehyde levels,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdHouse plants are reported to ‘clean’ formaldehyde from indoor environments and thus reduce its deleterious health effects. We measured formaldehyde removal rates at concentrations similar to those caused by new furniture or office photocopiers. We also measured CO2 and humidity changes, counted the stomata density and monitored leaf color and shape changes. Controls were an artificial polyester “fern” and methanol as the VOC. All plants reduced formaldehyde from 0.75 ppm to below 0.2 ppm in six hours. The plants fall into two major groups with different responses: one group showed high removal rates: Boston fern (0.85 m h−1), golden pothos (0.41 m h−1), Spanish moss (0.44 m h−1) and spider plant (0.40 m h−1) - faster than the artificial fern (0.09 m h−1). They also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde. Another group absorbed formaldehyde at a significantly lower rate (dumb cane: 0.07 m h−1; aloe vera: 0.17 m h−1; and Chinese evergreen: 0.09 m h−1) and had a generally different overall behavior from the ‘fast’ group - different CO2, humidity and variance changes - suggesting a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism. An ‘intermediate case’, snake plant (0.29 m h−1), has a slower rate than the fast group but also exhibited other changes, suggesting some combination of both mechanisms. Overall good correlations between formaldehyde uptake rates and stomata counts, total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rates were shown by all these plants.","['ENV', 'CHE']",foliage houseplant response to low formaldehyde level elsevi ltdhouse plant be report to clean formaldehyde from indoor environment and thus reduce its deleterious health effect we measure formaldehyde removal rate at concentration similar to those cause by new furniture or office photocopier we also measure co and humidity change count the stomata density and monitor leaf color and shape change control be an artificial polyester fern and methanol as the voc all plant reduce formaldehyde from ppm to below ppm in six hour the plant fall into two major group with different response one group show high removal rate boston fern m h golden pothos m h spanish moss m h and spider plant m h fast than the artificial fern m h they also show no change in color and appear to completely assimilate formaldehyde another group absorb formaldehyde at a significantly low rate dumb cane m h aloe vera m h and chinese evergreen m h and have a generally different overall behavior from the fast group different co humidity and variance change suggest a different formaldehyde absorption mechanism an intermediate case snake plant m h have a slow rate than the fast group but also exhibit other change suggest some combination of both mechanism overall good correlation between formaldehyde uptake rate and stomata count total leaf area and water evapotranspiration rate be show by all these plant
146,Preparation of aluminum magnesium oxide by different methods for use as PtSn catalyst supports in propane dehydrogenation,"© 2019Various magnesium aluminum oxides [Mg(Al)O] were prepared by physical mixing, hydrothermal, and solvothermal method (with and without calcination) and employed as supports for bimetallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The use of non-calcined Mg(Al)O-sv obtained from the solvothermal method led to the highest Pt dispersion, the lowest fraction of strong acid sites, and the lowest metallic tin species as well as coke content. Unlike the other catalysts that gradually deactivated with time-on-stream, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv maintained high propylene yield ˜26.9% during 5 h reaction time without any sign of catalyst deactivation. The improved catalyst performances were attributed not only to the high surface area flower-like nanosheet structure of the Mg(Al)O-sv but also the uniform Mg-O-Al bonding and high Al/Mg atomic ratio on the catalyst surface as confirmed by the XPS results.","['METAL', 'CHE']",preparation of aluminum magnesium oxide by different method for use as ptsn catalyst support in propane dehydrogenation various magnesium aluminum oxide mg al o be prepare by physical mixing hydrothermal and solvothermal method with and without calcination and employ as support for bimetallic ptsn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation the use of non calcine mg al o sv obtain from the solvothermal method lead to the high pt dispersion the low fraction of strong acid site and the low metallic tin specie as well as coke content unlike the other catalyst that gradually deactivate with time on stream the ptsn mg al o sv maintain high propylene yield during h reaction time without any sign of catalyst deactivation the improved catalyst performance be attribute not only to the high surface area flower like nanosheet structure of the mg al o sv but also the uniform mg o al bonding and high al mg atomic ratio on the catalyst surface as confirm by the xps result
147,Centralized Market Platform for Electric Vehicles in Residential Distribution Systems,"© 2023 IEEE.The number of electric vehicles (EVs) tends to increase steadily on a global scale. This causes the challenges in energy market for EVs in terms of electricity costs and technical effects on distribution systems. This paper proposes a centralized market platform managed by a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine the appropriate and appealing electricity costs for charging an EV without violating the power system's limits: bus voltage level, line capacity, and transformer loading limits. To complete the operations of the centralized market platform, the EV power and the bidding price from each EV owner who wishes to participate in the centralized market platform are collected through a single auction. The electricity costs for charging an EV are calculated by taking into account the maximum EV power as determined by the DSO so that the power system' limits are not violated. This paper modifies and employs a Thailand-typical 380-V distribution test system during off-peak and peak hours for the case study. The results show that during off-peak hours, the electricity costs for charging an EV range between 2.40 and 2.50 THB/kWh, while during peak hours, the electricity costs range between 3.50 and 5.40 THB/kWh. The decrease in EV charging costs will encourage EV owners to utilize their EVs.","['EE', 'IE']",centralize market platform for electric vehicle in residential distribution system ieee the number of electric vehicle evs tend to increase steadily on a global scale this cause the challenge in energy market for evs in term of electricity cost and technical effect on distribution system this paper propose a centralized market platform manage by a distribution system operator dso to determine the appropriate and appeal electricity cost for charge an ev without violate the power system s limit bus voltage level line capacity and transformer loading limit to complete the operation of the centralized market platform the ev power and the bidding price from each ev owner who wish to participate in the centralized market platform be collect through a single auction the electricity cost for charge an ev be calculate by take into account the maximum ev power as determine by the dso so that the power system limit be not violate this paper modifie and employ a thailand typical v distribution test system during off peak and peak hour for the case study the result show that during off peak hour the electricity cost for charge an ev range between and thb kwh while during peak hour the electricity cost range between and thb kwh the decrease in ev charge cost will encourage ev owner to utilize their evs
148,Performance of a geosynthetic cementitious composite mat for stabilising sandy slopes,"© 2019 Thomas Telford Ltd.In recent years, there has been much research interest in soil erosion and slope failure due to seepage and rainfall, especially toward finding new technologies/materials with which to stabilise soil slopes. Many geosynthetic materials have been developed to stabilise soil slopes while also being environmentally friendly and convenient for construction. In this study, the performance of a novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat (GCCM) is studied regarding its ability to stabilise soil slopes. Physical model tests are performed on sandy soil slopes under seepage conditions both with and without GCCM stabilisation. Particle image velocimetry is used to measure the soil displacement, and standpipe piezometers are used to monitor the pore water pressure of the slope. The results show that the slope displacement with GCCM stabilisation is much smaller than that without it. The presence of the GCCM constrains the displacement near the slope surface to being along the slope, whereas without the GCCM the slope can deform freely especially in the middle to upper zone of slope area. The results indicate that the GCCM performs well at slope stabilisation.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'MATSCI']",performance of a geosynthetic cementitious composite mat for stabilise sandy slope thomas telford ltd in recent year there have be much research interest in soil erosion and slope failure due to seepage and rainfall especially toward find new technology material with which to stabilise soil slope many geosynthetic material have be develop to stabilise soil slope while also be environmentally friendly and convenient for construction in this study the performance of a novel geosynthetic cementitious composite mat gccm be study regard its ability to stabilise soil slope physical model test be perform on sandy soil slope under seepage condition both with and without gccm stabilisation particle image velocimetry be use to measure the soil displacement and standpipe piezometer be use to monitor the pore water pressure of the slope the result show that the slope displacement with gccm stabilisation be much small than that without it the presence of the gccm constrain the displacement near the slope surface to be along the slope whereas without the gccm the slope can deform freely especially in the middle to upper zone of slope area the result indicate that the gccm perform well at slope stabilisation
149,Event-B formalization of basic supply chain patterns,"© 2018 IEEE.In recent years, as supply chains are increasingly becoming more valuable and dynamic, a large variety of compliance with high quality is needed for total safety and reliability. Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin.","['CPE', 'EDU', 'IE', 'SAFETY', 'MATH']",event b formalization of basic supply chain pattern ieee in recent year as supply chain be increasingly become more valuable and dynamic a large variety of compliance with high quality be need for total safety and reliability several business process model be propose to cope with the increase risk and complexity of the supply chain operation and event especially when the unexpected event cause by the time dependent behavior occur formal verification approach become more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase in practice a time petri net as a formal model be commonly use to graphically illustrate the time dependent behavior of a real time system however the simulation of the time petri net be tedious and inefficient for verify the huge and complex realtime system alternatively event b formalization approach provide an efficient and well automatic proving tool whilst the writing event b specification from scratch need the designer with the mathematical logic background in this paper we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary time petri net otpn as a formal model of the supply chain event which be easy and more understandable in the first place moreover we expect that several basic supply chain event pattern as build block of ordinary time petri net notation would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production process we hereafter propose a mean to transform the give ordinary time petri net of the supply chain event pattern into a complete event b specification which will be automatically prove by an event b prover call rodin

151,Optimization of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Patches for Repairing Fatigue Cracks in Steel Plates Using a Genetic Algorithm,"© 2020 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.A practical design optimization of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) patches for repairing fatigue cracks in metallic structures is presented. The design procedure combines finite-element (FE), genetic programming (GP), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An optimum patch design is defined as the combination of design parameters that simultaneously minimizes the patch volume and reduces the stress intensity factor (SIF) range below the fatigue threshold range. A patching correction factor, which accounts for the positive effects of material and geometric properties of the patch and adhesive layer on the SIF solution, is proposed. The correction factor is developed by performing symbolic regression via GP analyses on the SIF values obtained from the three-dimensional FE models. The closed-form SIF solution facilitates the visualization of the effects of design parameters, simplifies the calculation of fatigue life, and reduces the computation effort for design optimization. An example of the center-cracked steel plate subjected to constant amplitude fatigue loading and then repaired with double-sided adhesive-bonded FRP patches is used to illustrate the optimization procedure.","['CE', 'CPE', 'MATENG', 'IE', 'MATSCI']",optimization of fiber reinforce polymer patch for repair fatigue crack in steel plate use a genetic algorithm this work be make available under the term of the creative common attribution international license a practical design optimization of fiber reinforce polymer frp patch for repair fatigue crack in metallic structure be present the design procedure combine finite element fe genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga approach an optimum patch design be define as the combination of design parameter that simultaneously minimize the patch volume and reduce the stress intensity factor sif range below the fatigue threshold range a patch correction factor which account for the positive effect of material and geometric property of the patch and adhesive layer on the sif solution be propose the correction factor be develop by perform symbolic regression via gp analysis on the sif value obtain from the three dimensional fe model the close form sif solution facilitate the visualization of the effect of design parameter simplify the calculation of fatigue life and reduce the computation effort for design optimization an example of the center crack steel plate subject to constant amplitude fatigue loading and then repair with double sided adhesive bond frp patch be use to illustrate the optimization procedure
152,Improving short text classification using fast semantic expansion on multichannel convolutional neural network,"© 2018 IEEE.Nowadays, text classification is recognized as one of crucial tools for business users to gain more insights from customers. However, textual data from customers such as comments are usually short. Thus, there are two main issues in short text categorization: (1) insufficient contextual information and (2) noisy data due to misspellings. Recently, there is a prior attempt to propose a deep learning approach for short text categorization by expanding semantic using word embeddings clustering via an algorithm based on density peaks searching. Since the number of words in word embeddings is usually large, the clustering algorithm does not scale with the size of data set, thus demanding unacceptable computational cost. In this paper, we aim to propose a fast short-text categorization framework. Rather than using a CNN with k-max pooling layer, we propose to use a faster version of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called 'multichannel CNN.' To speed up the semantic expansion process, we propose to employ mini batch K-Means++, which is considerably faster and scales well with the size of data set. Furthermore, we also introduce an additional preprocessing step to increase vocabulary coverage rate on word embeddings. We conducted experiments on four public data sets: Google Snippets, TREC, MR, and Subj. The results showed that the proposed framework does not only improve an accuracy on all data sets, but also reduces computational costs from several days to a few hours.","['EE', 'CPE', 'EDU']",improve short text classification use fast semantic expansion on multichannel convolutional neural network ieee nowadays text classification be recognize as one of crucial tool for business user to gain more insight from customer however textual datum from customer such as comment be usually short thus there be two main issue in short text categorization insufficient contextual information and noisy datum due to misspelling recently there be a prior attempt to propose a deep learning approach for short text categorization by expand semantic use word embedding cluster via an algorithm base on density peak search since the number of word in word embedding be usually large the clustering algorithm do not scale with the size of datum set thus demand unacceptable computational cost in this paper we aim to propose a fast short text categorization framework rather than use a cnn with k max pooling layer we propose to use a fast version of convolutional neural network cnn call multichannel cnn to speed up the semantic expansion process we propose to employ mini batch k mean which be considerably fast and scale well with the size of datum set furthermore we also introduce an additional preprocessing step to increase vocabulary coverage rate on word embedding we conduct experiment on four public datum set google snippet trec mr and subj the result show that the propose framework do not only improve an accuracy on all data set but also reduce computational cost from several day to a few hour
153,Photovoltaic Power Generation Forecast by Using Estimator Model and Kalman Filter,"© 2019 IEEE.This paper presents an approach to forecast photovoltaic (PV) power generation by using Kalman filter and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). This method is suitable for real time forecast with high resolution time step and we use it to forecast for five-minute time step in this paper. However, Kalman filter requires real time measurement data to adjust forecast value, hence we propose an estimator model to help this approach to perform reliable forecast even when real time measurement data is unavailable. The dataset for building estimator model is set of historical data of power generation from neighbor PV rooftops and distance between PV rooftops. We use ARIMA model to estimate transition matrix for running Kalman filter. The performance of the test is measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Skill Score (SS).

There is distinction between the optimal control and NMPC. The optimal control aims to minimize the cost function over the finite horizon and applies the control input to the system. On the other hand, NMPC employs the state feedback and updates the control input at each time step. At each sampling time, the control design of NMPC is formulated as a two-point boundary-value (TPBV) problem. When the optimal control law is calculated, only the first control input is applied to the controlled system. We employ an iterative steepest descent algorithm to solve the TPBV problem. Numerical results show comparison between the optimal control and NMPC applied to the inverted pendulum.","['CPE', 'MATH']",nonlinear model predictive control of invert pendulum use iterative steep descent algorithm ieeethis paper present nonlinear model predictive control nmpc for nonlinear system and apply to the invert pendulum there be distinction between the optimal control and nmpc the optimal control aim to minimize the cost function over the finite horizon and apply the control input to the system on the other hand nmpc employ the state feedback and update the control input at each time step at each sampling time the control design of nmpc be formulate as a two point boundary value tpbv problem when the optimal control law be calculate only the first control input be apply to the control system we employ an iterative steep descent algorithm to solve the tpbv problem numerical result show comparison between the optimal control and nmpc apply to the invert pendulum
156,Assessment of heat-to-power ratio in a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell system,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdA solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand.","['PE', 'ME', 'EE', 'CHE']",assessment of heat to power ratio in a bio oil sorption enhance steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell system elsevi ltda solid oxide fuel cell sofc be a high efficiency technology for combine heat and power chp generation heat and power production can be vary accord to change in heat and power load which affect the electrical and thermal efficiency this study analyze change in heat and power production rate of a bio oil sorption enhance steam reform sesr and sofc system the variation in the stack to burner ratio bio oil split fraction fuel utilization factor uf and recirculation ratio r be investigate the effect of heat to power ratio on the system performance and co capture efficiency be also study moreover the benefit of the implementation of a bio oil sesr and sofc system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case be evaluate the result reveal that an increase in uf decrease the operating range of the heat to power ratio on the other hand the anode gas recirculation ratio affect such a parameter when the system perform at the high stack to burner ratio a high heat to power ratio increase the stack electrical and thermal efficiency lead to a high chp efficiency the heat to power ratio of the propose system vary between and however to attain a co capture efficiency high than the heat to power ratio should be low than by compare the two operational strategy fix heat to power ratio and variable heat to power ratio it be find that the heat to power ratio be an important factor for energy management the primary energy saving be enhance when the system be operate to satisfy the rate of heat and power demand

158,Simple and effective technology for sustainable biodiesel production using high-power household fruit blender,"© 2019A commercial household fruit blender is proposed as a simple, less time-consuming, and effective biodiesel production technique in this research work. Biodiesel was successfully produced in a 1200 W commercial household fruit blender. Due to the synergistic effect derived from the very high rotational speed of the blender blades integrated with micro-mixing level from cavitation phenomena, heat and mass transfer became greatly enhanced. The vigorous stirring inherently increased the temperature of the methanol-oil mixture to greater than 60 °C in less than 3 min, thus, a provision of external heating was not required. With a methanol to fresh refined palm oil molar ratio of 6:1 and 1 wt% sodium hydroxide catalyst, the FAME yield of 94.5% can be achieved in less than 3 min with the yield efficiency of 33.8 × 10−4 g/J for 500 mL of reaction volume. For 1000 mL of reaction volume at 1 min of reaction time, the FAME yield of 79.9% can be achieved with the yield efficiency of 122.3 × 10−4 g/J. Properties of the produced FAME comply with the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. In conclusion, these results indicate that a high-power commercial household fruit blender can be utilized to produce biodiesel economically and effectively.","['PE', 'ME', 'CHE', 'AGRI', 'IE']",simple and effective technology for sustainable biodiesel production use high power household fruit blender a commercial household fruit blender be propose as a simple less time consume and effective biodiesel production technique in this research work biodiesel be successfully produce in a w commercial household fruit blender due to the synergistic effect derive from the very high rotational speed of the blender blade integrate with micro mix level from cavitation phenomenon heat and mass transfer became greatly enhance the vigorous stirring inherently increase the temperature of the methanol oil mixture to great than c in less than min thus a provision of external heating be not require with a methanol to fresh refined palm oil molar ratio of and wt sodium hydroxide catalyst the fame yield of can be achieve in less than min with the yield efficiency of g j for ml of reaction volume for ml of reaction volume at min of reaction time the fame yield of can be achieve with the yield efficiency of g j property of the produce fame comply with the en and astm d standard in conclusion these result indicate that a high power commercial household fruit blender can be utilize to produce biodiesel economically and effectively
159,Bifunctional Catalyst NiFe-MgAl for Hydrogen Production from Chemical Looping Ethanol Reforming,"© 2021 American Chemical Society.Ethanol, especially that produced from biomass, is considered as a renewable and carbon-neutral candidate to produce hydrogen. Performances of NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts, in terms of activity, stability, and regenerability, in chemical looping reforming (CLR) of ethanol were studied. The NiFe-MgAl bifunctional catalysts were prepared from hydrotalcite-like compounds by the co-precipitation method. Various characterization techniques, that is, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy, were used to determine properties of fresh and spent catalysts. In addition, O2 temperature-programmed oxidation, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman analyses were used for observation of coke formation on the spent catalysts. Meanwhile, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy can verify the evolution of the catalyst during the reactions. It was observed that the NiFe-MgAl catalyst showed higher catalytic activity and stability than the monometallic Fe-MgAl and Ni-MgAl catalysts. More specifically, the NiFe-MgAl catalyst provided the highest H2 concentration up to 80% at a low reaction temperature of 500 °C. This high performance was ascribed to the formation of Ni-Fe alloy particles. The combination of pulse experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis elucidated that the iron particle at the surface was in the form of FeO that can oxidize the carbon deposits, resulting in the suppression of coke formation. In addition, the NiFe-MgAl catalyst can maintain high hydrogen selectivity for 10 repeated cycles.","['PE', 'METAL', 'OPTIC', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",bifunctional catalyst nife mgal for hydrogen production from chemical loop ethanol reform american chemical society ethanol especially that produce from biomass be consider as a renewable and carbon neutral candidate to produce hydrogen performance of nife mgal bifunctional catalyst in term of activity stability and regenerability in chemical looping reform clr of ethanol be study the nife mgal bifunctional catalyst be prepare from hydrotalcite like compound by the co precipitation method various characterization technique that be x ray diffraction inductively couple plasma nitrogen adsorption desorption h temperature program reduction and transmission electron microscopy be use to determine property of fresh and spend catalyst in addition o temperature program oxidation scan electron microscopy and raman analysis be use for observation of coke formation on the spend catalyst meanwhile in situ diffuse reflectance infrare fourier transform spectroscopy can verify the evolution of the catalyst during the reaction it be observe that the nife mgal catalyst show high catalytic activity and stability than the monometallic fe mgal and ni mgal catalyst more specifically the nife mgal catalyst provide the high h concentration up to at a low reaction temperature of c this high performance be ascribe to the formation of ni fe alloy particle the combination of pulse experiment and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis elucidate that the iron particle at the surface be in the form of feo that can oxidize the carbon deposit result in the suppression of coke formation in addition the nife mgal catalyst can maintain high hydrogen selectivity for repeat cycle
160,Silver decorated reduced graphene oxide as electrocatalyst for zinc–air batteries,"© 2020 by the authors.Due to their low cost and very high energy density, zinc–air batteries (ZABs) exhibit high potential for various energy applications. The electrochemical performance of the air-cathode has a decisive impact on the discharge performance of ZABs because the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics increase the overpotential of the air-cathode and hence the performance of ZABs. In this work, reduced graphene oxide decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNP/rGO) is synthesized using simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide and silver ions.

161,Miniaturized Hybrid Couplers Using Quarter- Wave-Like Transformers,"© 2018 KIEES.This paper presents the miniaturization of a hybrid coupler for microwave frequency. The size reduction is achieved by the use of quarter-wave-like transformers (QWLTs) implemented by properly designed conjugately characteristic-impedance transmission lines (CCITLs). The QWLT has a shorter physical length than the conventional quarter-wave transformer (QWT) for matching the same impedance. The 25% size reduction has been achieved for the present hybrid coupler without significant performance degradation. The miniaturization of a hybrid coupler can consequently reduce the size of the circuit composing it, and thus possibly decreasing the manufacturing cost.",['EE'],miniaturize hybrid coupler use quarter wave like transformer kiee this paper present the miniaturization of a hybrid coupler for microwave frequency the size reduction be achieve by the use of quarter wave like transformer qwlt implement by properly design conjugately characteristic impedance transmission line ccitls the qwlt have a short physical length than the conventional quarter wave transformer qwt for match the same impedance the size reduction have be achieve for the present hybrid coupler without significant performance degradation the miniaturization of a hybrid coupler can consequently reduce the size of the circuit compose it and thus possibly decrease the manufacturing cost

163,Heuristic based scheduling for tablets film coating process,"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.In the pharmaceutical industry, tablets film coating planning concerns a finding of coating sequences on parallel machines such that both the completion time and number of tardy jobs are minimized. This problem is made more difficult when a wide variety of drugs is produced as changing from one to another drug requires considerably long period of cleaning and setup times - these times also vary depending on the previously coated drug. We show that this problem could be transformed into the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW), where a variable arc exch an ge heur istic - whose concep t is based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) - is devised to solve such a problem. Our proposed heuristic is a two-phase one, where the initial solutions are constructed from easy-to-implement dispatching heuristics, i.e. Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Longest Processing Time (LPT). The initial solution is then iteratively improved by a series of local-search operators, including 2OPT, RELOCATION, and SWAP. The results from our proposed heuristic is comparatively good, when compared to those of the optimization model in terms of solution quality as the gap is less than 5% for instances of 20 orders; but, it requires much less computation time, which is crucial from a practical point of view.","['MATENG', 'MATH']",heuristic base scheduling for tablet film coating process association for compute machinery in the pharmaceutical industry tablet film coat planning concern a finding of coat sequence on parallel machine such that both the completion time and number of tardy job be minimize this problem be make more difficult when a wide variety of drug be produce as change from one to another drug require considerably long period of cleaning and setup time these time also vary depend on the previously coat drug we show that this problem could be transform into the vehicle routing problem with time window vrptw where a variable arc exch an ge heur istic whose concep t be base on the variable neighborhood search vns be devise to solve such a problem our propose heuristic be a two phase one where the initial solution be construct from easy to implement dispatch heuristic I e early due date edd and long processing time lpt the initial solution be then iteratively improve by a series of local search operator include opt relocation and swap the result from our propose heuristic be comparatively good when compare to those of the optimization model in term of solution quality as the gap be less than for instance of order but it require much less computation time which be crucial from a practical point of view
164,Early Stress Detection in Plant Phenotyping using CNN and LSTM Architecture,"© 2021 IEEE.In order to ensure the availability of food in the future, plant stress identification is one of the crucial tasks used in plant phenotyping to develop better crops. In this research, we use a convolution neural network (CNN) combined with LSTM to identify the early state of plant stress caused by a deficiency of nutrients. We use a treatment study dataset of sorghum (S. bicolor) which consists of more than 40,000 images of growing sorghum images captured in the phenotyping facility in 3 views. The experiment studies plant growing under 3 treatment conditions: 100/100 (100% ammonium/100% nitrate), 50/10, and 10/10. The network is divided into two parts: the features extraction and classification network. VGG16 with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset is used as the feature extractor. LSTM cell with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to classify extracted features to determine the stress of the plants after subjected to the stressor. The result revealed that the network can detect the stress at the accuracy of more than 85% at 2 days after plants subjected to the stressor treatment.",['EE'],early stress detection in plant phenotype use cnn and lstm architecture ieee in order to ensure the availability of food in the future plant stress identification be one of the crucial task use in plant phenotype to develop well crop in this research we use a convolution neural network cnn combine with lstm to identify the early state of plant stress cause by a deficiency of nutrient we use a treatment study dataset of sorghum s bicolor which consist of more than image of grow sorghum image capture in the phenotype facility in view the experiment study plant grow under treatment condition ammonium nitrate and the network be divide into two part the feature extraction and classification network vgg with pre train weight from the imagenet dataset be use as the feature extractor lstm cell with multi layer perceptron mlp be use to classify extract feature to determine the stress of the plant after subject to the stressor the result reveal that the network can detect the stress at the accuracy of more than at day after plant subject to the stressor treatment
165,Potential of carbon dioxide storage from petroleum industries in the Gulf of Thailand for green production,"© 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, climate change and global warming are the global concern because of an increase in the huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This gas comes from energy activities and industries like petroleum industries. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the practical technology to reduce and storage CO2. In Thailand, one of the main potential sites for storage is the Gulf of Thailand. However, the research on this issue is very rare in Thailand. Consequently, this work is aiming on the potential study of CO2 geological storage in formations in the Gulf of Thailand by using simulation. The CO2 storage capacity, pressure buildup and plume migration have been estimated. Also, this study has been simulated with various conditions. CO2 injection is used from 1,000-4,000 tons per day with the depth from 2,200-2,330 meters and the results are studied for 50 years as a monitoring period. The results present that with the formation characteristics, CO2 storage in this area has potential. Moreover, pressure buildup and plume migration are illustrated for the period of 50 years. As a fundamental knowledge, this study can contribute to CO2 storage in an offshore area in Thailand.","['ENV', 'CHE']",potential of carbon dioxide storage from petroleum industry in the gulf of thailand for green production publish under licence by iop publish ltd recently climate change and global warming be the global concern because of an increase in the huge amount of carbon dioxide co in the atmosphere this gas come from energy activity and industry like petroleum industry carbon capture and storage ccs be the practical technology to reduce and storage co in thailand one of the main potential site for storage be the gulf of thailand however the research on this issue be very rare in thailand consequently this work be aim on the potential study of co geological storage in formation in the gulf of thailand by use simulation the co storage capacity pressure buildup and plume migration have be estimate also this study have be simulate with various condition co injection be use from ton per day with the depth from meter and the result be study for year as a monitoring period the result present that with the formation characteristic co storage in this area have potential moreover pressure buildup and plume migration be illustrate for the period of year as a fundamental knowledge this study can contribute to co storage in an offshore area in thailand
166,Analysis of cutting-oil emulsion destabilization by aluminum sulfate,"© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The destabilization mechanism of the high stable cutting-oil emulsion by aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3) was investigated since it can affect properties of aggregates and following separation units. Al2(SO4)3 dosage and pH were key factors in the destabilization. The effective separation occurred when precipitated Al(OH)3 is dominated at the neutral pH of 6.5–7.0. The best separation can be achieved when solid flocs were formed at 1.0 mM, which exceeded the dosage from the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of 0.75 mM. Two different mechanisms were proved for the emulsion destabilization depending upon the Al3+ concentration under this pH range. The first mechanism was the adsorption of Al(OH)3 on surface of oil droplets, which led to the droplet coalescence. By increasing the Al3+ dosage, the sweep flocculation by Al(OH)3 precipitates occurred. Al3+ dosage for effective destabilization was increased in accordance with oil concentration. The formation of aluminum hydroxide precipitates in bayerite structure was affirmed by analyzing elemental composition and crystalline structure of flocs from the destablization.",['CHE'],analysis of cut oil emulsion destabilization by aluminum sulfate informa uk limited trading as taylor francis group the destabilization mechanism of the high stable cut oil emulsion by aluminum sulfate al so be investigate since it can affect property of aggregate and follow separation unit al so dosage and ph be key factor in the destabilization the effective separation occur when precipitate al oh be dominate at the neutral ph of the good separation can be achieve when solid floc be form at mm which exceed the dosage from the critical coagulation concentration ccc of mm two different mechanism be prove for the emulsion destabilization depend upon the al concentration under this ph range the first mechanism be the adsorption of al oh on surface of oil droplet which lead to the droplet coalescence by increase the al dosage the sweep flocculation by al oh precipitate occur al dosage for effective destabilization be increase in accordance with oil concentration the formation of aluminum hydroxide precipitate in bayerite structure be affirm by analyze elemental composition and crystalline structure of floc from the destablization
167,A Matrix Decomposition Method for Odd-Type Gaussian Normal Basis Multiplication,"© 2018 IEEE.Normal basis is used in many applications because of the efficiency of the implementation. However, most space complexity reduction techniques for binary field multiplier are applicable for only optimal normal basis or Gaussian normal basis of even type. There are 187 binary fields GF 2k for k from 2 to 1,000 that use odd-type Gaussian normal basis. This paper presents a method to reduce the space complexity of odd-type Gaussian normal basis multipliers over binary field GF 2k. The idea is adapted from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis. The result shows that our space complexity reduction method can reduce the number of XOR gates used in the implementation comparing to previous works with a small trade-off in critical path delay.","['CPE', 'MATH']",a matrix decomposition method for odd type gaussian normal basis multiplication ieee normal basis be use in many application because of the efficiency of the implementation however most space complexity reduction technique for binary field multiplier be applicable for only optimal normal basis or gaussian normal basis of even type there be binary field gf k for k from to that use odd type gaussian normal basis this paper present a method to reduce the space complexity of odd type gaussian normal basis multiplier over binary field gf k the idea be adapt from the matrix decomposition method for optimal normal basis the result show that our space complexity reduction method can reduce the number of xor gate use in the implementation compare to previous work with a small trade off in critical path delay

By using SDN, virtual switches can be reprogrammed to drop attacker traffics at the earliest possible locations. This is advantageous in comparison with the current industrial practice whereby only a firewall sitting at the network domain border or a gateway can perform such dropping action. The testbed uses the GNS3 platform where OVS switches are constructed and controlled by the Opendaylight controller.

169,Design and Optimisation of a Power Efficient High-Altitude Platform for Equatorial Operation,"© 2018 IEEE.High-altitude Platform (HAP) is an aircraft cruising in stratosphere for surveillance and telecommunication. There are three main types of HAPs: a fixed wing aeroplane, an airship, and a balloon. This study aims at designing an unmanned solar-powered aeroplane for communication, functioning as a satellite. The values of solar radiation power on the equinox, summer solstice and winter solstice were estimated as well as a required power from each mission profile. Those values of the required power and the available one were used as constraints for a required solar cell area and a required battery capacity. Then, the wing planform was sized. To optimise the wing, three aerofoils with different tip dihedral angles were simulated with ANSYS so that the one with the optimal rolling, pitching and yawing moments could be selected. The mass of each aircraft component was later estimated, tail was sized based on those masses and their locations. The static margin was calculated to validate the tail sizing with the HAP centre of mass. The verification of power consumption was also performed by a simulation of the whole aircraft. The final conceptual HAP model is equipped with 19.5-aspect-ratio Eppler 397 wing with an angle of incidence of 5 degrees and tip dihedral angle of 8 degree at 7.5 metres from the longitudinal centre line.","['ENV', 'EE']",design and optimisation of a power efficient high altitude platform for equatorial operation ieee high altitude platform hap be an aircraft cruise in stratosphere for surveillance and telecommunication there be three main type of hap a fix wing aeroplane an airship and a balloon this study aim at design an unmanned solar powered aeroplane for communication function as a satellite the value of solar radiation power on the equinox summer solstice and winter solstice be estimate as well as a require power from each mission profile those value of the require power and the available one be use as constraint for a require solar cell area and a require battery capacity then the wing planform be sized to optimise the wing three aerofoil with different tip dihedral angle be simulate with ansys so that the one with the optimal rolling pitching and yawing moment could be select the mass of each aircraft component be later estimate tail be size base on those masse and their location the static margin be calculate to validate the tail sizing with the hap centre of mass the verification of power consumption be also perform by a simulation of the whole aircraft the final conceptual hap model be equip with aspect ratio eppler wing with an angle of incidence of degree and tip dihedral angle of degree at metre from the longitudinal centre line
170,Effects of ferrihydrite-impregnated powdered activated carbon on phosphate removal and biofouling of ultrafiltration membrane,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The presence of multiple contaminant species in surface waters makes surface water treatment difficult to accomplish through a single process. Herein, we evaluated the ability of an integrated adsorption/ultrafiltration (UF) membrane filtration system to simultaneously remove phosphates and dissolved organic matter (DOM). When bare powdered activated carbon (PAC) and PAC impregnated with amorphous ferrihydrite (FHPAC) adsorbents were compared, FHPAC showed a greater adsorption rate and capacity for phosphate. FHPAC had a phosphate adsorption capacity of 2.32 mg PO43−/g FHPAC, even when DOM was present as a competing adsorbate. In a lab-scale hybrid FHPAC-UF system (i.e. integrated adsorption by FHPAC with UF membrane filtration), irreversible membrane fouling was ca. three times lower than that in a PAC-UF system. When membrane fouling in the PAC-UF system was described with pore blockage models, we found that the main cause of fouling was bacterial deposition on the membrane surface. CLSM analysis determined that the chemical composition of foulants in the PAC-UF system included higher proportions of proteins, nucleic acids, and alpha-polysaccharides than that in the FHPAC-UF system. Overall, FHPAC’s ability to undergo ligand exchanges with DOM helped to reduce the nutrients and bacteria that cause biofouling to accumulate on the membrane surface.","['ENV', 'BME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",effect of ferrihydrite impregnate powdered activate carbon on phosphate removal and biofouling of ultrafiltration membrane by the author licensee mdpi basel switzerland the presence of multiple contaminant specie in surface water make surface water treatment difficult to accomplish through a single process herein we evaluate the ability of an integrate adsorption ultrafiltration uf membrane filtration system to simultaneously remove phosphate and dissolve organic matter dom when bare powder activate carbon pac and pac impregnate with amorphous ferrihydrite fhpac adsorbent be compare fhpac show a great adsorption rate and capacity for phosphate fhpac have a phosphate adsorption capacity of mg po g fhpac even when dom be present as a compete adsorbate in a lab scale hybrid fhpac uf system I e integrate adsorption by fhpac with uf membrane filtration irreversible membrane fouling be ca three time low than that in a pac uf system when membrane fouling in the pac uf system be describe with pore blockage model we find that the main cause of fouling be bacterial deposition on the membrane surface clsm analysis determine that the chemical composition of foulant in the pac uf system include high proportion of protein nucleic acid and alpha polysaccharide than that in the fhpac uf system overall fhpac s ability to undergo ligand exchange with dom help to reduce the nutrient and bacteria that cause biofouling to accumulate on the membrane surface
171,Simulation using representative data selection for transboundary radiation effect evaluation by Nuclear Accident Consequence Analysis Code (NACAC),"© 2023 Atomic Energy Society of Japan. All rights reserved.Global radionuclide dispersion from Fukushima nuclear accident urged several countries to begin evaluating the radiation effects from neighboring countries. The representative data selection simulation is one of the evaluation methods providing practical results with reasonable computational resources. However, it is mostly used in the domestic radiation effect evaluation. This study investigated and modified this simulation method for transboundary radiation effect evaluation. The effects of selected area boundaries, optional weather parameters, and sampling rate, critical parameters in the representative data selection scheme, are sequentially investigated on the calculated results. The evaluation is performed by Nuclear Accident Consequence Analysis Code (NACAC) with hypothetical accidents at Fangchenggang NPP in China. It is revealed that area boundary and optional weather parameter selection insignificantly impact the predicted results, but the sampling rate condition affects the predicted results. Good agreements comprising dispersion characteristics and total effective dose equivalent by simulation using representative and sequential data selections are shown with absolute mean bias error lower than 2.4 × 10−3 mSv, root mean square error lower than 5.7 × 10−4 mSv, and correlation coefficient value higher than 9.1 × 10−1.","['ENV', 'CPE', 'SAFETY', 'MATH']",simulation use representative datum selection for transboundary radiation effect evaluation by nuclear accident consequence analysis code nacac atomic energy society of japan all right reserve global radionuclide dispersion from fukushima nuclear accident urge several country to begin evaluate the radiation effect from neighboring country the representative data selection simulation be one of the evaluation method provide practical result with reasonable computational resource however it be mostly use in the domestic radiation effect evaluation this study investigate and modify this simulation method for transboundary radiation effect evaluation the effect of select area boundary optional weather parameter and sample rate critical parameter in the representative data selection scheme be sequentially investigate on the calculate result the evaluation be perform by nuclear accident consequence analysis code nacac with hypothetical accident at fangchenggang npp in china it be reveal that area boundary and optional weather parameter selection insignificantly impact the predict result but the sample rate condition affect the predict result good agreement comprise dispersion characteristic and total effective dose equivalent by simulation use representative and sequential datum selection be show with absolute mean bias error low than msv root mean square error low than msv and correlation coefficient value high than
172,Preparation of hydrothermal carbon acid catalyst from defatted rice bran,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, the effects of carbonization conditions: temperature (180–250 °C) and time (1–8 h) on the yield and the chemical characteristics of hydrothermal carbon derived from defatted rice bran (HTCDRB) were determined. The morphological and chemical characteristics of the sulfonated HTCDRB catalyst were also examined. In addition, the stability of the catalyst was evaluated based on the amounts of biomass conversion products (5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, levulinic acid and formic acid) leached into water at a specified biomass conversion condition. Since no HMF and furfural, and only small amounts of levulinic acid (1.75 wt.%), and formic acid (0.42 wt.%), were leached from the catalyst synthesized from HTCDRB prepared at the carbonization condition of 220 °C for 3 h, this condition was suggested to be a suitable carbonization condition. Despite having similar structural and chemical characteristics, the leaching test suggested that the DRB-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst was found to be more stable than the glucose-based hydrothermal carbon catalyst, prepared at the same condition. The catalytic activity for cellulose hydrolysis of the catalyst was higher than that of the commercial Amberlyst 16 WET catalyst.","['PE', 'CHE']",preparation of hydrothermal carbon acid catalyst from defatted rice bran elsevi b v in this study the effect of carbonization condition temperature c and time h on the yield and the chemical characteristic of hydrothermal carbon derive from defatted rice bran htcdrb be determine the morphological and chemical characteristic of the sulfonated htcdrb catalyst be also examine in addition the stability of the catalyst be evaluate base on the amount of biomass conversion product hydroxymethylfurfural hmf furfural levulinic acid and formic acid leach into water at a specify biomass conversion condition since no hmf and furfural and only small amount of levulinic acid wt and formic acid wt be leach from the catalyst synthesize from htcdrb prepare at the carbonization condition of c for h this condition be suggest to be a suitable carbonization condition despite have similar structural and chemical characteristic the leach test suggest that the drb base hydrothermal carbon catalyst be find to be more stable than the glucose base hydrothermal carbon catalyst prepare at the same condition the catalytic activity for cellulose hydrolysis of the catalyst be high than that of the commercial amberlyst wet catalyst
173,Au-catalyzed desorption of GaAs oxides,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.Thermal desorption of native oxides on GaAs(100), (110) and (111)B surfaces around Au particles are studied in vacuum using in situ microspectroscopy. Two temperature-dependent desorption regimes, common to all surfaces, are identified. The low-temperature desorption regime spatially limited to the vicinity of some Au nanoparticles (NPs) is catalytically enhanced, resulting in oxide pinholes which expand laterally into macro holes many times the size of the catalyzing NPs and with shapes dictated by the underlying crystallography. The high-temperature desorption regime causes homogeneous oxides thinning and, ultimately, complete oxide desorption. The temperature difference between the two regimes is ∼25 °C-60 °C. After oxide desorption and depending on Au size and GaAs surface orientation, Au particles may dissolve the fresh GaAs surface and form mobile AuGa2/Ga core/shell units, or form stationary AuGa2 crystallites, or the catalyzing Au particles may run with minimal reaction with the GaAs surface. These results will add to the fundamental understanding of many Au-based nanofabrication processes, particularly the epitaxial growth of vertical and lateral nanowires.","['ENV', 'METAL', 'ME', 'EE', 'NANO', 'CHE']",au catalyzed desorption of gaas oxide iop publish ltd thermal desorption of native oxide on gaas and b surface around au particle be study in vacuum use in situ microspectroscopy two temperature dependent desorption regime common to all surface be identify the low temperature desorption regime spatially limit to the vicinity of some au nanoparticles nps be catalytically enhance result in oxide pinhole which expand laterally into macro hole many time the size of the catalyze nps and with shape dictate by the underlie crystallography the high temperature desorption regime cause homogeneous oxide thinning and ultimately complete oxide desorption the temperature difference between the two regime be c c after oxide desorption and depend on au size and gaas surface orientation au particle may dissolve the fresh gaas surface and form mobile auga ga core shell unit or form stationary auga crystallite or the catalyze au particle may run with minimal reaction with the gaas surface these result will add to the fundamental understanding of many au base nanofabrication process particularly the epitaxial growth of vertical and lateral nanowire
174,Empirical Stress Intensity Factor Equations for Cracked Steel Plates Repaired with Double-Sided FRP Patches,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This paper presents an approach that combines the finite element (FE) modeling and genetic programming (GP) to provide accurate empirical stress intensity factor (SIF) equations for center-cracked steel plates repaired with adhesive-bonded double-sided fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) patches. Several past studies in recent years independently showed that the reduction on the SIF of cracked structures after the patch repair is dependent on many factors such as bonding techniques, material parameters, geometric parameters, environmental factors. In this study, the SIF of the repaired cracked steel plate was considered to be a function of seven parameters including the crack length, elastic modulus of FRP material, shear modulus of adhesive material, dimensions (width, length, and thickness) of rectangular FRP patches, and thickness of adhesive layers. Empirical SIF equations were created by the data mining process of genetic programming analyses performed on a database created from the FE results. The SIF values obtained from these equations were also compared with an analytical equation to assess whether their ability to perform well on a certain design or not. It was found that the proposed SIF equations fitted well with the FE results as the squared Pearson correlation coefficients R2 are higher than 0.9. In addition, the correlations between proposed equations and the analytical equation are approximately 0.8.","['CE', 'CPE', 'MATENG', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",empirical stress intensity factor equation for crack steel plate repair with double sided frp patch publish under licence by iop publish ltd this paper present an approach that combine the finite element fe modeling and genetic programming gp to provide accurate empirical stress intensity factor sif equation for center crack steel plate repair with adhesive bond double sided fiber reinforce polymer frp patch several past study in recent year independently show that the reduction on the sif of crack structure after the patch repair be dependent on many factor such as bond technique material parameter geometric parameter environmental factor in this study the sif of the repaired crack steel plate be consider to be a function of seven parameter include the crack length elastic modulus of frp material shear modulus of adhesive material dimension width length and thickness of rectangular frp patch and thickness of adhesive layer empirical sif equation be create by the datum mining process of genetic programming analysis perform on a database create from the fe result the sif value obtain from these equation be also compare with an analytical equation to assess whether their ability to perform well on a certain design or not it be find that the propose sif equation fit well with the fe result as the squared pearson correlation coefficient r be high than in addition the correlation between propose equation and the analytical equation be approximately

176,Wheel Slip Angle Estimation of a Planar Mobile Platform,"© 2019 IEEE.Wheeled mobile robots and simplified motion of an automobile on a flat surface are common applications of a planar mobile platform. Improving the quality of state variable feedback under the lack of global positioning is imperative for enhancing the motion control performance. This paper proposes an alternative method of wheel slip angle estimation requiring only on-board measurement. The kinematics-based analytical solution is derived so that the slip angle of any free-rolling wheel can be estimated from the measured information of the wheel rolling speed and steering angle, along with the yaw rate and the linear accelerations of the mobile platform. The complete estimation of state variables: traveling speed, sideslip and radius of curvature is obtained from kinematic relationships. An experimental prototype of planar mobile platform is modified from a scaled RWD vehicle with free-rolling front wheel. During extremely sliding random motion, the estimated wheel slip angle and state variables are validated with the motion captured data.

177,Synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolite via bacterial cellulose-derived carbon templating for fast adsorption of formaldehyde,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Mesoporous ZSM-5 (MFI) zeolite was synthesized by using bacterial cellulose-derived activated carbon (BC-AC500) with a high surface area as a hard template. Different ratios of BC-AC500 and zeolite precursor gel were prepared in a Teflon-lined autoclave and crystallized at 180 °C for 48 h in a rotating oven. The physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning/transmission electron microscopies (SEM/TEM), and N2 physisorption techniques. It was found that the mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites have a specific surface area of 184-190 m2/g, a high mesopore volume of 0.120–0.956 ml/g and a wide pore size distribution ranging from 5 to 100 nm with a maximum at approximately 25.3 nm. The successfully made mesoporous ZSM-5 was tested as an adsorbent for formaldehyde adsorption in batch mode.

178,Biomethanation of Napier Grass Mono-digestion in Single-Stage Anaerobic Completely Stirred Tank Reactors Seeded with Cow Manure and Anaerobic Sludge,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.This study aimed to evaluate methane productivity of Napier grass mono-digestion in single-stage anaerobic completely stirred tank reactors (CSTR) inoculated differently by cow manure (COM), anaerobic sludge (ANS), and a mix of COM and ANS for CSTR1 to 3, respectively. The different inoculation promoted operational performance, stability, and organic loading rate (OLR) differently. The produced biogas and methane varied significantly with OLR (p < 0.05). The maximum gas productivities between 0.42–0.48 L-biogas/g VSadded and 0.27–0.34 L-CH4/g VSadded were obtained at OLR of 1.0–1.5 g VS/L day. Later, the increase in OLR to 2.0 and 2.4 g VS/L day decreased biogas and methane yields by 24.85–39.65% and 11.66–52.89%. Co-inoculation of COM and ANS was a promising strategy that encouraged more stability in CSTR3 than the other reactors. Consequently, the methanogenic performance was developed in all digesters, depicted clearly by high methane content between 52.94 and 59.30% in produced biogas. A similar microbial structure was found in each CSTR-dominated predominantly by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Formicates. About 0.5–3.0% of the whole populations were archaea identified distinctly to Methanocorpusculum, Methanospirillum, and Methanosaeta. This finding confirmed the importance of seed inoculation to practical gas productivity and confined organic loading capacity of Napier grass biomethanation in single-stage wet and mono-substrate digestion processes.","['ENV', 'ME', 'CHE', 'AGRI']",biomethanation of napier grass mono digestion in single stage anaerobic completely stir tank reactor seed with cow manure and anaerobic sludge the author s under exclusive licence to springer science business medium llc part of springer nature this study aim to evaluate methane productivity of napier grass mono digestion in single stage anaerobic completely stir tank reactor cstr inoculate differently by cow manure com anaerobic sludge ans and a mix of com and ans for cstr to respectively the different inoculation promote operational performance stability and organic loading rate olr differently the produce biogas and methane vary significantly with olr p the maximum gas productivity between l biogas g vsadde and l ch g vsadde be obtain at olr of g vs l day later the increase in olr to and g vs l day decrease biogas and methane yield by and co inoculation of com and ans be a promising strategy that encourage more stability in cstr than the other reactor consequently the methanogenic performance be develop in all digester depict clearly by high methane content between and in produce biogas a similar microbial structure be find in each cstr dominate predominantly by proteobacteria bacteroidete and formicate about of the whole population be archaea identify distinctly to methanocorpusculum methanospirillum and methanosaeta this finding confirm the importance of seed inoculation to practical gas productivity and confine organic loading capacity of napi grass biomethanation in single stage wet and mono substrate digestion process

However, the application of ZigBee for outdoor applications is still not mature since the characteristic of signal strength depends on the outdoor conditions. To solve this issue, the received signal strength index (RSSI) and packet delivery are measured in real outdoor conditions for wireless neighborhood area network (WNAN) planning and optimization. Unfortunately, these important data are usually not publicly available for academic use. In this data article, RSSI data and packet delivery rate of a wireless network based on ZigBee 2.4 GHz are collected at the on-street condition, considering the effect of moving and stopping vehicles. In addition, the transmission ranges at two module location levels are also collected. The data provided in this article will help to estimate the transmission range, avoid the interferences and adjust the power level of ZigBee devices for many outdoor applications.","['CE', 'CPE']",receive signal strength datum of zigbee technology for on street environment at ghz band and the interruption of vehicle to link quality the authorszigbee technique be the common wireless network approach for many smart indoor management application such as home energy management or building management system however the application of zigbee for outdoor application be still not mature since the characteristic of signal strength depend on the outdoor condition to solve this issue the receive signal strength index rssi and packet delivery be measure in real outdoor condition for wireless neighborhood area network wnan planning and optimization unfortunately these important datum be usually not publicly available for academic use in this datum article rssi datum and packet delivery rate of a wireless network base on zigbee ghz be collect at the on street condition consider the effect of move and stop vehicle in addition the transmission range at two module location level be also collect the datum provide in this article will help to estimate the transmission range avoid the interference and adjust the power level of zigbee device for many outdoor application
181,"Machine learning methods for abnormality detection in hard disk drive assembly process: Bi-LSTM, Wavelet-CNN and SVM","© 2018 IEEE.The research proposes methods to detect abnormality in assembly of a hard disk drive. Three machine learning techniques are employed to classify the drives from assembly process into good and bad class.

183,Maximization of PV size for its limitation in MEA grid code by considering overvoltage and increased active power loss criteria,"© 2019 IEEE.A photovoltaic (PV) limitation in Thailand grid code has been based only on an average light load to protect the reverse power flow caused by PV systems installed into a LV distribution grid. However, injecting PV power during the light load occurrence can cause overvoltage and increased active power loss impacts on the distribution system. The objective of this paper is to determine the maximum PV size used to set the installation limit in Thailand grid code. The system voltages and the active power loss are used to be constraints of the optimization problem. A Direct Search method is employed and developed on the DIgSILENT PowerFactory program. The simulated system is constructed from typical data of Thailand distribution grids, while the load flow calculation is carried out on the average light load condition of Metropolitan Electricity Fig. 1.

Three simulation cases are studied: (1) PV installed at the beginning of the line, (2) PV installed at the middle of the line, and (3) PV installed at the end of the line. The results show that when a PV system with an appropriate size is installed, its impacts will be mitigated, and that the PV size can be the highest if its location is at the beginning of the line. Since the simulated system is typically constructed, the results and analyses can be applied broadly and imposed on the MEA's grid code.","['EE', 'CPE', 'CHE']",maximization of pv size for its limitation in mea grid code by consider overvoltage and increase active power loss criterion ieee a photovoltaic pv limitation in thailand grid code have be base only on an average light load to protect the reverse power flow cause by pv system instal into a lv distribution grid however inject pv power during the light load occurrence can cause overvoltage and increase active power loss impact on the distribution system the objective of this paper be to determine the maximum pv size use to set the installation limit in thailand grid code the system voltage and the active power loss be use to be constraint of the optimization problem a direct search method be employ and develop on the digsilent powerfactory program the simulate system be construct from typical datum of thailand distribution grid while the load flow calculation be carry out on the average light load condition of metropolitan electricity fig thailand s pv instal capacity from to until june authority mea thailand three simulation case be study pv instal at the beginning of the line pv instal at the middle of the line and pv instal at the end of the line the result show that when a pv system with an appropriate size be instal its impact will be mitigate and that the pv size can be the high if its location be at the beginning of the line since the simulate system be typically construct the result and analysis can be apply broadly and impose on the mea s grid code
184,Discussion of some recent literature on hydrogen-embrittlement mechanisms: Addressing common misunderstandings,"©2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.There have been several reviews and numerous papers on hydrogen-embrittlement phenomena and mechanisms in the past few years, but long-standing controversies regarding mechanisms of embrittlement (when hydride phases are not involved) are no closer to being resolved despite all the recent research. These controversies have arisen partly because there have been significant misunderstandings of some of the proposed mechanisms, and some misinterpretation of experimental observations. There has also been a lack of consideration of all the evidence, with some researchers ignoring observations that do not fit their favoured hypothesis. Some recent reviews and papers illustrating the above points are discussed in the present paper, although a comprehensive coverage is not attempted. It is concluded that the adsorption-induced dislocation-emission/void-coalescence mechanism predominates for cleavage-like and intergranular fracture modes that exhibit microscale or nanoscale dimples. Hydrogen-enhanced decohesion, hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity, and vacancy-based mechanisms may play secondary roles for such fracture modes and could be more important in other cases.","['METAL', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",discussion of some recent literature on hydrogen embrittlement mechanism address common misunderstanding walter de gruyter gmbh berlin boston there have be several review and numerous paper on hydrogen embrittlement phenomenon and mechanism in the past few year but long stand controversy regard mechanism of embrittlement when hydride phase be not involve be no close to be resolve despite all the recent research these controversy have arise partly because there have be significant misunderstanding of some of the propose mechanism and some misinterpretation of experimental observation there have also be a lack of consideration of all the evidence with some researcher ignore observation that do not fit their favour hypothesis some recent review and paper illustrate the above point be discuss in the present paper although a comprehensive coverage be not attempt it be conclude that the adsorption induce dislocation emission void coalescence mechanism predominate for cleavage like and intergranular fracture mode that exhibit microscale or nanoscale dimple hydrogen enhance decohesion hydrogen enhance localise plasticity and vacancy base mechanism may play secondary role for such fracture mode and could be more important in other case

189,Use of an internal fibrous biofilter for intermittent nitrification and denitrification treatments in a zero-discharge shrimp culture tank,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.To achieve water reuse in recirculating aquaculture systems, intermittent nitrification and denitrification processes using internal fibrous media was proposed. A pre-acclimated Biocord biofilter, with an initial nitrification rate of 17.1 ± 12.4 mg total ammonia nitrogen-N/m2/d was applied in a marine whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture tank. Throughout the experiment, the aerobic nitrification activity of the biofilter was sufficient to control the ammonia and nitrite levels below 0.2 mg-N/L with an accumulation of nitrate up to 50 mg-N/L. The remaining nitrate was successfully removed after shrimp harvest with the same biofilter through anoxic denitrification in conjunction with a methanol supplement at a chemical oxygen demand: nitrate-N ratio of 5:1. With complete nitrogen removal, the water was re-aerated and the next crop of shrimp culture was initiated. In this study, a two-crop shrimp cultivation was performed in sequence in the same tank without water exchange. The microbial diversity was monitored using high-throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, which demonstrated that Proteobacteria (45.3 %), Chloroflexi (18.4 %), and Bacteroidetes (17.1 %) were the most abundant phyla. With an emphasis on nitrogen removal, the family Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae were the dominant nitrifying bacteria during the aerobic nitrification, while a high relative abundance of the Methylophaga and Methylotenera genera was observed under the anoxic condition.","['ENV', 'BME', 'ME', 'CHE', 'AGRI']",use of an internal fibrous biofilter for intermittent nitrification and denitrification treatment in a zero discharge shrimp culture tank elsevi b v to achieve water reuse in recirculating aquaculture system intermittent nitrification and denitrification process use internal fibrous medium be propose a pre acclimate biocord biofilter with an initial nitrification rate of mg total ammonia nitrogen n m d be apply in a marine whiteleg shrimp litopenaeus vannamei culture tank throughout the experiment the aerobic nitrification activity of the biofilter be sufficient to control the ammonia and nitrite level below mg n l with an accumulation of nitrate up to mg n l the remain nitrate be successfully remove after shrimp harvest with the same biofilter through anoxic denitrification in conjunction with a methanol supplement at a chemical oxygen demand nitrate n ratio of with complete nitrogen removal the water be re aerate and the next crop of shrimp culture be initiate in this study a two crop shrimp cultivation be perform in sequence in the same tank without water exchange the microbial diversity be monitor use high throughput sequence on illumina miseq which demonstrate that proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidete be the most abundant phyla with an emphasis on nitrogen removal the family nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae be the dominant nitrify bacteria during the aerobic nitrification while a high relative abundance of the methylophaga and methylotenera genera be observe under the anoxic condition

All rights reserved.A protective ballistic armor used for military buildings, that will meet the anti-terrorism and force protection demands, are increasingly needed, particularly in Thailand's southernmost provinces. A new type of ballistic armor system has been developed, composing of composite layers, using natural rubber reinforced with steel wire mesh, and Al plate. The composite layers were used as front material while the Al plate was used as backing plate. The armors were tested against NIJ-Type III threats using NIJ 0108.01 ballistic test standard. The armor, with 12 mm Al backing plate, can successfully resist the NIJ-Type III treat with only combination of two composite layers. Different than hard and brittle plate, such as ceramic, the use of composite layer at the front did not blunt and erode the projectile, due to its ductile property. However, the composite layer effectively reduces the velocity of projectile, due to high fracture toughness, as a result of reinforcing steel wire mesh layers in the composites. The projectile was finally stopped by the Al backing plate.","['CE', 'METAL', 'CPE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",developement of composite armor use natural rubber reinforce with steel wire mesh for ballistic resistance institute of physics publish all right reserve a protective ballistic armor use for military building that will meet the anti terrorism and force protection demand be increasingly need particularly in thailand s southernmost province a new type of ballistic armor system have be develop composing of composite layer use natural rubber reinforce with steel wire mesh and al plate the composite layer be use as front material while the al plate be use as back plate the armor be test against nij type iii threat use nij ballistic test standard the armor with mm al back plate can successfully resist the nij type iii treat with only combination of two composite layer different than hard and brittle plate such as ceramic the use of composite layer at the front do not blunt and erode the projectile due to its ductile property however the composite layer effectively reduce the velocity of projectile due to high fracture toughness as a result of reinforce steel wire mesh layer in the composite the projectile be finally stop by the al back plate

The simulation tool is composed of a passenger arrival model for a single or group of elevators, their control system, and a graphical user interface (GUI). The developed GUI can display statistical information of the passengers traffic pattern and also the animation of elevator cars with the number of passengers inside. The current version allows both individual and batch Poisson arrival processes which could represent up-peak traffic in the morning and after lunch of office buildings respectively. The motion of elevator cars has been precisely modeled with real parameters of velocity, acceleration, distance, and jerk. However, only the basic nearest car algorithm is implemented for elevator group control systems.

The synthesis of hierarchical HY not only increased the tungsten dispersion in the forms of isolated tungstate oxo species (mono-oxo and di-oxo) by increasing the terminal silanol group density of the support for these oxides to be grafted on but also greatly reduced the heavy hydrocarbon formation simultaneously by elimination of some alumina from the zeolite. As a consequence, higher propene conversion was obtained without the undesired reactions especially during the initial stage, when the metallocarbene was not fully developed. The results present a facile method for the development of heterogeneous WOx-based metathesis catalysts and a better correlation between the surface properties of catalyst support and the formation of tungsten pre-catalysis active species.","['METAL', 'CHE']",formation of isolated tungstate site on hierarchical structured sio and hy zeolite support wox catalyst for propene metathesis the formation of isolated tungstate site on hierarchical structured sio nanoparticle and hy zeolite with high si al ratio si al be investigate in the self metathesis of propene over support wox base catalyst the synthesis of hierarchical hy not only increase the tungsten dispersion in the form of isolated tungstate oxo species mono oxo and di oxo by increase the terminal silanol group density of the support for these oxide to be graft on but also greatly reduce the heavy hydrocarbon formation simultaneously by elimination of some alumina from the zeolite as a consequence high propene conversion be obtain without the undesired reaction especially during the initial stage when the metallocarbene be not fully develop the result present a facile method for the development of heterogeneous wox base metathesis catalyst and a well correlation between the surface property of catalyst support and the formation of tungsten pre catalysis active specie

196,Photocatalytic zinc oxide on flexible polyacrylonitrile nanofibers via sol–gel coaxial electrospinning,"© 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.Photocatalysts on nanofibers provide a large surface area for high photocatalytic activity, prevent nanoparticle aggregation, and facilitate easy separation from the process fluids. In this work, zinc oxide (ZnO) photocatalysts on flexible polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were prepared via single-step deposition by sol–gel coaxial electrospinning. A core/sheath structure consisting of the PAN polymer covered with a ZnO–polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) mixture was fabricated and then calcined at high temperatures to remove the PVP and crystallize the ZnO. The concentrations and viscosities of PAN and PVP were varied to find the appropriate conditions for nanofiber production.

197,A multiplayer and activities based approach to Chulalongkorn Virtual Interactive Memorial Hall,"© 2023 IEEE.Chulalongkorn University is the premier university in Thailand, and its memorial hall is a historical landmark that showcases the prestigious history and accomplishments of the university. As a result of coronavirus-related closures, the number of visitors who were able to visit this memorial was drastically lower over the last two years, and some relics were prohibited from being visited and appreciated as well. As a solution to these problems, a virtual tour using metaverse technology is described in this paper; specifically, the memorial hall is modeled digitally using three-dimensional (3D) models, and users can observe the virtual museum environment and perform various activities virtually. A mechanism called the multiplayer approach is adopted, where several visitors can enjoy the museum's tour simultaneously by using our web-based metaverse. An activity-based environment is created where the visitors can play the piano, find ancient items hidden inside the museum, and get a reward upon successful completion of the task. It is believed that this virtual tour will meet a visitor's needs while at the same time safeguarding priceless cultural and historical artifacts and other sources of knowledge.","['CE', 'BME', 'CPE']",a multiplayer and activity base approach to chulalongkorn virtual interactive memorial hall ieee chulalongkorn university be the premier university in thailand and its memorial hall be a historical landmark that showcase the prestigious history and accomplishment of the university as a result of coronavirus relate closure the number of visitor who be able to visit this memorial be drastically low over the last two year and some relic be prohibit from be visit and appreciate as well as a solution to these problem a virtual tour use metaverse technology be describe in this paper specifically the memorial hall be model digitally use three dimensional d model and user can observe the virtual museum environment and perform various activity virtually a mechanism call the multiplayer approach be adopt where several visitor can enjoy the museum s tour simultaneously by use our web base metaverse an activity base environment be create where the visitor can play the piano find ancient item hide inside the museum and get a reward upon successful completion of the task it be believe that this virtual tour will meet a visitor s need while at the same time safeguard priceless cultural and historical artifact and other source of knowledge
198,Classification models for stock's performance prediction: A case study of finance sector in the stock exchange of Thailand,"© 2018 IEEE.Within stock market, the objective of both stock buyers and sellers is to make profit on price difference based on their expectation on a company's current and future value. There is no investing strategy that is considered to be the best by experts, and investing decision criteria remain contingent upon an individual investor's experiences and bias. To address the challenges, this paper uses financial ratios and company's industry data of stocks in finance sector of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) to construct two classification models predicting (i) whether stock's one-year return will outperform the SET Index and (ii) whether the return will be positive. Various classification techniques, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are explored, whose performances are evaluated by Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Based on the AUC values, we can conclude that, on average, all methods are comparatively good, with LR and LDA being the most useful classifiers for risk averse investors- A s both are not subject to uncertainty due to true positive counting bias.","['CPE', 'MATH']",classification model for stock s performance prediction a case study of finance sector in the stock exchange of thailand ieee within stock market the objective of both stock buyer and seller be to make profit on price difference base on their expectation on a company s current and future value there be no investing strategy that be consider to be the good by expert and invest decision criterion remain contingent upon an individual investor s experience and bias to address the challenge this paper use financial ratio and company s industry datum of stock in finance sector of the stock exchange of thailand set to construct two classification model predict I whether stock s one year return will outperform the set index and ii whether the return will be positive various classification technique include logistic regression lr decision tree dt linear discriminant analysis lda and k near neighbor knn be explore whose performance be evaluate by area under the curve auc of the receiver operate characteristic roc curve base on the auc value we can conclude that on average all method be comparatively good with lr and lda be the most useful classifier for risk averse investor a s both be not subject to uncertainty due to true positive counting bias

200,Incorporation of hydrogen by-product from NaOCH3 production for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation: Process analysis and economic evaluation,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdA major problem regarding the production of methanol via the CO2 hydrogenation is the source of hydrogen that is still expensive and not economically sustainable. Utilization of hydrogen available as a by-product from other processes may resolve such issue. In this work; therefore, we evaluate the potentiality of incorporating the hydrogen by-product from the NaOCH3 production for the synthesis of methanol via hydrogenation of CO2, a greenhouse gas released from industry. Due to the limited availability of hydrogen from NaOCH3 production, a detailed analysis of kinetic in the reactor systems including, 1) the adiabatic fixed bed, 2) the isothermal multi-tube, and 3) the adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with an intercooler, are simulated using Aspen Plus in order to select the most appropriate reactor system that maximizes the conversion of hydrogen and CO2. The adiabatic fixed bed reactor appears the most appropriate since it consumes the highest amount of CO2, and shows the highest Profitability Index when compared to other reactor systems. In addition, methanol produced from this proposed process can provide a 16.4% reduction in the methanol feedstock required for the upstream process of NaOCH3 production. An analysis using Aspen Economic is also performed in this work which reveals that the saving cost generated from the recycle of methanol to the upstream process is almost comparable to the costs of construction and operation of the process of methanol synthesis. According to our useful sensitivity analysis, a methanol price as well as hydrogen and CO2 feed rates directly influenced the feasibility of the proposed process. The obtained result indicates that this proposed process is potentially feasible when 1) the price of methanol increases, and 2) the availability of hydrogen increases due to the increased NaOCH3 production capacity over than 1.5 times of the current scale.","['ENV', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'IE', 'MATH']",incorporation of hydrogen by product from naoch production for methanol synthesis via co hydrogenation process analysis and economic evaluation elsevi ltda major problem regard the production of methanol via the co hydrogenation be the source of hydrogen that be still expensive and not economically sustainable utilization of hydrogen available as a by product from other process may resolve such issue in this work therefore we evaluate the potentiality of incorporate the hydrogen by product from the naoch production for the synthesis of methanol via hydrogenation of co a greenhouse gas release from industry due to the limited availability of hydrogen from naoch production a detailed analysis of kinetic in the reactor system include the adiabatic fix bed the isothermal multi tube and the adiabatic fix bed reactor with an intercooler be simulate use aspen plus in order to select the most appropriate reactor system that maximize the conversion of hydrogen and co the adiabatic fix bed reactor appear the most appropriate since it consume the high amount of co and show the high profitability index when compare to other reactor system in addition methanol produce from this propose process can provide a reduction in the methanol feedstock require for the upstream process of naoch production an analysis use aspen economic be also perform in this work which reveal that the saving cost generate from the recycle of methanol to the upstream process be almost comparable to the cost of construction and operation of the process of methanol synthesis accord to our useful sensitivity analysis a methanol price as well as hydrogen and co feed rate directly influence the feasibility of the propose process the obtain result indicate that this propose process be potentially feasible when the price of methanol increase and the availability of hydrogen increase due to the increase naoch production capacity over than time of the current scale

202,Heterogeneous Suzuki cross-coupling reaction in water catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles supported on individual calcium carbonate plates derived from mussel shell particle,"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.A new palladium nanoparticles catalyst supported on individual calcium carbonate plates (Pd/ICCP) is made from Asian green mussel shells and used as heterogeneous catalyst in Suzuki cross coupling reaction. The reduction of palladium (II) generates palladium (0) nanoparticles which can embed on individual calcium carbonate plates (ICCP) to give Pd/ICCP. The prepared Pd/ICCP catalyst is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), indicating an entire dispersion of palladium onto the surface of individual calcium carbonate plates. Furthermore, palladium content in the prepared Pd/ICCP catalyst is determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The optimized study is investigated in Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 4-iodoanisole and phenylboronic acid. It reveals that using potassium carbonate in mixed solvent of EtOH: H2O (3:2) in the presence of 2 mol% of Pd/ICCP give 4-methoxybiphenyl in 90% isolated yield at 40 oC. Moreover, in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as phase transfer agent, the reaction can perform in water as a sole solvent to give the product in excellent yield under the same condition.","['NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",heterogeneous suzuki cross coupling reaction in water catalyze by palladium nanoparticle support on individual calcium carbonate plate derive from mussel shell particle elsevier ltd all right reserve a new palladium nanoparticle catalyst support on individual calcium carbonate plate pd iccp be make from asian green mussel shell and use as heterogeneous catalyst in suzuki cross coupling reaction the reduction of palladium ii generate palladium nanoparticle which can embed on individual calcium carbonate plate iccp to give pd iccp the prepared pd iccp catalyst be characterize by scan electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx indicate an entire dispersion of palladium onto the surface of individual calcium carbonate plate furthermore palladium content in the prepared pd iccp catalyst be determine by inductively couple plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oe the optimize study be investigate in suzuki cross coupling reaction between iodoanisole and phenylboronic acid it reveal that use potassium carbonate in mixed solvent of etoh h o in the presence of mol of pd iccp give methoxybiphenyl in isolate yield at oc moreover in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab as phase transfer agent the reaction can perform in water as a sole solvent to give the product in excellent yield under the same condition
203,"Heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of diuron on zinc oxide: Influence of surface-dependent adsorption on kinetics, degradation pathway, and toxicity of intermediates","© 2019Heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction has been generally applied for degradation of toxic contaminants. Degradations of a compound using the same kind of catalyst that was synthesized differently are commonly found in literature. However, the reported degradation intermediates are normally inconsistent. This issue is especially important for the degradation of toxic compounds because intermediates may be more toxic than their parent compounds and understanding the reason is necessary if appropriate catalysts are to be designed. This work systematically compares the photocatalytic degradation of diuron, a toxic recalcitrant herbicide, on two forms of zinc oxide (ZnO), i.e., conventional particles with zinc- and oxygen-terminated polar surfaces as the dominating planes, and nanorods with mixed-terminated nonpolar surfaces. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that both the rate of reaction and the degradation pathway depend on the adsorption configuration of diuron onto the surface. Diuron molecules adsorb in different alignments on the two surfaces, contributing to the formation of different degradation intermediates. Both the aliphatic and aromatic sides of diuron adsorb on the polar surfaces simultaneously, leading to an attack by hydroxyl radicals from both ends. On the other hand, on the mixed-terminated surface, only the aliphatic part adsorbs and is degraded. The exposed surface is therefore the key factor controlling the degradation pathway. For diuron degradation on ZnO, a catalyst confined to mixed-terminated surfaces, i.e., ZnO nanorods, is more desirable, as it avoids the formation of intermediates with potent phytotoxicity and cytogenotoxicity.","['BME', 'ME', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of diuron on zinc oxide influence of surface dependent adsorption on kinetic degradation pathway and toxicity of intermediate heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction have be generally apply for degradation of toxic contaminant degradation of a compound use the same kind of catalyst that be synthesize differently be commonly find in literature however the report degradation intermediate be normally inconsistent this issue be especially important for the degradation of toxic compound because intermediate may be more toxic than their parent compound and understand the reason be necessary if appropriate catalyst be to be design this work systematically compare the photocatalytic degradation of diuron a toxic recalcitrant herbicide on two form of zinc oxide zno I e conventional particle with zinc and oxygen terminate polar surface as the dominate plane and nanorod with mixed terminate nonpolar surface experimental and theoretical result indicate that both the rate of reaction and the degradation pathway depend on the adsorption configuration of diuron onto the surface diuron molecule adsorb in different alignment on the two surface contribute to the formation of different degradation intermediate both the aliphatic and aromatic side of diuron adsorb on the polar surface simultaneously lead to an attack by hydroxyl radical from both end on the other hand on the mixed terminated surface only the aliphatic part adsorb and be degrade the expose surface be therefore the key factor control the degradation pathway for diuron degradation on zno a catalyst confine to mixed terminate surface I e zno nanorod be more desirable as it avoid the formation of intermediate with potent phytotoxicity and cytogenotoxicity
204,A review of underlying reasons for intergranular cracking for a variety of failure modes and materials and examples of case histories,"© 2019The reasons why cracking and corrosion can occur preferentially along grain boundaries in a wide variety of metallic materials are discussed, along with case histories of failures involving intergranular fracture and corrosion. Failure modes discussed include fast fracture, fatigue (in inert and embrittling environments), liquid-metal embrittlement, hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, and corrosion fatigue, in materials such as steels, Al alloys, Ni alloys, and Cu alloys. The features sometimes observed on grain-boundary facets (e.g. fatigue striations, crack-arrest markings, slip lines, steps/microfacets, nano−/micro-scale dimples, second-phase particles, and deposits), and how they are formed, are described, as such knowledge helps in diagnosing fracture modes and causes. Reasons for intergranular cracking in the cases considered include (i) preferential precipitation at grain boundaries (sometimes with an associated precipitate-free zone), (ii) segregation of metalloid impurities, hydrogen, or some alloying elements, (iii) preferential adsorption of embrittling environmental species (such as some metal atoms and hydrogen) at intersections of grain boundaries with surfaces/crack tips, and (iv) locally anodic regions at or adjacent to grain boundaries. Some lessons for failure-analysis and prevention in general, illustrated by the case histories, are then summarised.","['METAL', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",a review of underlie reason for intergranular crack for a variety of failure mode and material and example of case history the reason why crack and corrosion can occur preferentially along grain boundary in a wide variety of metallic material be discuss along with case history of failure involve intergranular fracture and corrosion failure mode discuss include fast fracture fatigue in inert and embrittle environment liquid metal embrittlement hydrogen embrittlement stress corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue in material such as steels al alloy ni alloy and cu alloy the feature sometimes observe on grain boundary facet e g fatigue striation crack arrest marking slip line step microfacet nano micro scale dimple second phase particle and deposit and how they be form be describe as such knowledge help in diagnose fracture mode and cause reason for intergranular crack in the case consider include I preferential precipitation at grain boundary sometimes with an associate precipitate free zone ii segregation of metalloid impurity hydrogen or some alloy element iii preferential adsorption of embrittle environmental specie such as some metal atom and hydrogen at intersection of grain boundary with surface crack tip and iv locally anodic region at or adjacent to grain boundary some lesson for failure analysis and prevention in general illustrate by the case history be then summarise

208,Generation and selection of Pareto-optimal solution for the sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification system with solid oxide fuel cell,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe biomass gasification coupled with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for combined heat and power generations. For the development and improvement of the integrated process systems, the optimization problem has more than one conflicting objective functions to be optimized (i.e., thermodynamic performance, environmental impacts, annual profit, capital and operating costs) simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions. In this work, MOO of a sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification (SEG) integrated with an SOFC and gas turbine (GT) system, for combined heat and power production from Eucalyptus wood chips as biomass feedstock, is investigated. Firstly, the model of this integrated plant is developed in Aspen Plus that can be divided into five parts: (1) SEG, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC, (4) catalytic burning, GT and CO2 compression, and (5) Portland cement production. As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions. The Pareto-optimal solutions are ranked based on the normalized variations for decision variables uncertainty. At the end of this study, robust MOO of the integrated plant is performed, with respect to uncertainties in the market and operating parameters.","['CE', 'ENV', 'ME', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'IE', 'MATH']",generation and selection of pareto optimal solution for the sorption enhance steam biomass gasification system with solid oxide fuel cell elsevi ltdthe biomass gasification couple with a solid oxide fuel cell sofc system be one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technology for combined heat and power generation for the development and improvement of the integrate process system the optimization problem have more than one conflict objective function to be optimize I e thermodynamic performance environmental impact annual profit capital and operating cost simultaneously multi objective optimization moo method be use to find a set of optimal or non dominate solution in this work moo of a sorption enhance steam biomass gasification seg integrate with an sofc and gas turbine gt system for combine heat and power production from eucalyptus wood chip as biomass feedstock be investigate firstly the model of this integrate plant be develop in aspen plus that can be divide into five part seg hot gas cleaning and steam reform sofc catalytic burning gt and co compression and portland cement production as the annual profit demonstrate the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost acc indicate availability of investment the moo of the integrate plant be perform to obtain pareto optimal solution base on the minimization of acc and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variable after that ten selection method be use to recommend practical solution for implement in the integrate plant in order to explore the effect of decision variable uncertainty on obtain pareto optimal solution random variation in decision variable be use to quantify deviation in objective function the pareto optimal solution be rank base on the normalize variation for decision variable uncertainty at the end of this study robust moo of the integrate plant be perform with respect to uncertainty in the market and operating parameter

210,"Recent developments on bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX; X = Cl, Br, I) based ternary nanocomposite photocatalysts for environmental applications","© 2021 Elsevier LtdPhotocatalytic treatment of organic pollutants present in wastewater using semiconductor nanomaterials under light irradiation is one of the efficient advanced oxidation processes. Stable metal oxide (e.g. TiO2) based semiconductor photocatalytic systems have been mainly investigated for this purpose. Nevertheless, their large band gap (~3.2 eV) makes them inefficient in utilization of visible light portion of solar light leading to a lower degradation efficiency. Investigations have focused on the development of visible light responsive bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX; X = Cl, Br, I), one of the potential nanomaterials with unique layered structure, for efficient absorption of solar light for the degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers limits their practical applicability. To overcome such drawbacks, the development of BiOX based ternary nanocomposites received significant attention because of their unique structural and electronic properties, improved visible light response and increased separation and transfer rate of photogenerated charge carriers. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments on bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites for enhanced environmental pollutants decomposition under visible light irradiation. The principles of photocatalysis, synthetic methodologies of bismuth oxyhalides and their characteristics such as heterojunctions formation, improved visible light response and separation rate of charge carriers and the mechanisms for enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity are discussed. In addition, the future prospects on the improvement in the photocatalytic activity of bismuth oxyhalides-based ternary nanocomposites are also discussed.

211,Topological evolution of public transportation network: A case study of Bangkok rail transit network,"© 2018 IEEE.Bangkok Rail Transit Network (BRTN) is the first urban rail transit system in Thailand, initially operated in 1999. Once completed in 2029, the BRTN will be one of the world largest urban rail transit networks, with 285 stations accounting for 508 kilometers of travel distance. To investigate and explain the topological evolution of BRTN from 1999 to 2029, five network indicators were selected, including network diameter, gamma index, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. We found that, as the BRTN evolves, both diameter and gamma index seemingly rise indicating better spread and connectivity over time. Likewise, average degree centrality increases from 1.91 to 2.27, while both average closeness and betweenness centrality gradually decline; but with different intensity patterns. More specifically, stations with high closeness tend to be those in the central Bangkok area as they conveniently reach the rest of the network with fewer links; however, as betweenness gives more weights to stations that facilitate transportation, stations with high betweenness tend to be those joining central area to the suburbs.","['EE', 'MATH']",topological evolution of public transportation network a case study of bangkok rail transit network ieee bangkok rail transit network brtn be the first urban rail transit system in thailand initially operate in once complete in the brtn will be one of the world large urban rail transit network with station account for kilometer of travel distance to investigate and explain the topological evolution of brtn from to five network indicator be select include network diameter gamma index degree centrality closeness centrality and betweenness centrality we find that as the brtn evolve both diameter and gamma index seemingly rise indicate well spread and connectivity over time likewise average degree centrality increase from to while both average closeness and betweenness centrality gradually decline but with different intensity pattern more specifically station with high closeness tend to be those in the central bangkok area as they conveniently reach the rest of the network with few link however as betweenness give more weight to station that facilitate transportation station with high betweenness tend to be those join central area to the suburb

Sampled Values is a basic message protocol for the application of Wide Area Measurement and Control (WAMPAC), which requires manageable communication in a wide area over Ethernet layer. In this regard, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has recently been introduced as one of the communication technologies with that capability. This paper has reported on our first-step findings towards the development of a tool to help checking the feasibility of SDN technology in smart grid applications. Since the smart grid applications must be delay-critical, timing performances become essential and all the modules to be used in the tool development must be verified on that aspect. Particularly, for this paper, Mininet and ONOS controller have been tested. Their ability to emulate transmission link delay values is quantified and reported for the practical range of smart grid application usages.","['EE', 'CPE']",validation of sdn emulator base on mininet and onos controller for iec packet delay measurement ieee to guarantee the electrical power stability for economic and industry growth the power grid would need to adopt the technology of smart grid with the enablement of new communication technology iec have be introduce for the upgrading of an electrical substation to digital substation compose of many digital device that help automate the electrical power control for the purpose of power stability sample value be a basic message protocol for the application of wide area measurement and control wampac which require manageable communication in a wide area over ethernet layer in this regard software define networking sdn have recently be introduce as one of the communication technology with that capability this paper have report on our first step finding towards the development of a tool to help check the feasibility of sdn technology in smart grid application since the smart grid application must be delay critical timing performance become essential and all the module to be use in the tool development must be verify on that aspect particularly for this paper mininet and onos controller have be test their ability to emulate transmission link delay value be quantify and report for the practical range of smart grid application usage
214,Modelling an Extension Decision of BOT Transportation Infrastructure: A Risk-Adjusted Approach,"© 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.Thailand has a long history in welcoming the private sector to participate in the development of large-scale infrastructure projects through a program called public private partnership or PPP. Build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-transfer-operate (BTO) are two of commonly used PPP contracts for transportation infrastructure, in which the private (or the concessionaire) is responsible for the risks relating to the design, finance, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of the project. As some of PPP transportation infrastructure projects in Thailand are approaching its final year of a concession period, decision as to extend or to end the contract must be made by a contracting agency, that is: (1) to extend the concession contract to the existing concessionaire for a certain period of years or (2) to let the concession expire and to have a responsible public agency assume the operation. This paper is to propose a decision-making model based on a level of risk exposure as a computational tool for comparing between a renewal package offered by the concessionaire and expected benefits generated under the operation by the public agency. A case study project, a BOT elevated road located in Bangkok, will be used to illustrate the application of the proposed model. One of the implications of this study is that the estimated figure computed using the proposed method may be treated as a public sector comparator (PSC), which can be used as an initial benchmark for the negotiation with the existing or a new concessionaire.","['CE', 'IE', 'SAFETY']",model an extension decision of bot transportation infrastructure a risk adjust approach american society of civil engineer thailand have a long history in welcome the private sector to participate in the development of large scale infrastructure project through a program call public private partnership or ppp build operate transfer bot and build transfer operate bto be two of commonly use ppp contract for transportation infrastructure in which the private or the concessionaire be responsible for the risk relate to the design finance construction and operation and maintenance o m of the project as some of ppp transportation infrastructure project in thailand be approach its final year of a concession period decision as to extend or to end the contract must be make by a contracting agency that be to extend the concession contract to the exist concessionaire for a certain period of year or to let the concession expire and to have a responsible public agency assume the operation this paper be to propose a decision make model base on a level of risk exposure as a computational tool for compare between a renewal package offer by the concessionaire and expect benefit generate under the operation by the public agency a case study project a bot elevated road locate in bangkok will be use to illustrate the application of the propose model one of the implication of this study be that the estimate figure compute use the propose method may be treat as a public sector comparator psc which can be use as an initial benchmark for the negotiation with the exist or a new concessionaire

All rights reserved.The subsoil of Samutprakarn province in Thailand consists of thick sensitive very soft clay layer. The construction, such as pile driving and excavation work would lead to reduce the shear strength of very soft clay or induce the excess pore pressure on very soft clay. This paper presents the results of pile driving around the press pit reinforced concrete structure which was excavated and constructed on the very soft sensitive clay. The pile driving effect surrounding the press pit caused the uplift of press pit. The uplift of press pit was investigated by additional soil investigation, piezometer installation as well as coring the base slab of press pit. The investigation result was analyzed for clarifying the uplift behaviors before remedial work. At present, the remedial work was already completed.","['CE', 'PE', 'ME']",uplift of very sensitive soft clay due to pile driving international association of lowland technology all right reserve the subsoil of samutprakarn province in thailand consist of thick sensitive very soft clay layer the construction such as pile driving and excavation work would lead to reduce the shear strength of very soft clay or induce the excess pore pressure on very soft clay this paper present the result of pile drive around the press pit reinforce concrete structure which be excavate and construct on the very soft sensitive clay the pile drive effect surround the press pit cause the uplift of press pit the uplift of press pit be investigate by additional soil investigation piezometer installation as well as core the base slab of press pit the investigation result be analyze for clarify the uplift behavior before remedial work at present the remedial work be already complete
216,Multi-objective worker allocation optimisation in a multiple U-line system,"© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate two operational modes of the worker allocation problem (WAP) in the multiple U-line system (MULS). Five objectives are optimised simultaneously for the most complicated operational modes, i.e. machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking. Besides, the benefits of using multiline workstations (MLWs) are investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The elite non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III (ENSDE III) algorithm is developed as a solution technique. Also, the largest remaining available time heuristic is proposed as a baseline in determining the number and utilisation of workers when the use of MLWs is not allowed. Findings: ENSDE III outperforms the cutting-edged multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, i.e. multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and non-dominated sorting differential evolutionary III, under two key Pareto metrics, i.e. generational distance and inverted generational distance, regardless of the problem size. The best-found number of workers from ENSDE III is substantially lower than the upper bound. The MULS with MLWs requires fewer workers than the one without. Research limitations/implications: Although this research has extended several issues in the basic model of multiple U-line systems, some assumptions were used to facilitate mathematical computation as follows. The U-line system in this research assumed that all lines were produced only a single product. Besides, all workers were well-trained to gain the same skill. These assumptions could be extended in the future. Practical implications: The implication of this research is the benefits of multiline workstations (MLWs) used in the multiple U-line system. Instead of leaving each individual line to operate independently, all lines should be working in parallel through the use of MLWs to gain benefits in terms of worker reduction, balancing worker’s workload, higher system utilisation. Originality/value: This research is the first to address the WAP in the MULS with machine-dominant working and fixed-station walking modes. Worker’s fatigue due to standing and walking while working is incorporated into the model. The novel ENSDE III algorithm is developed to optimise the multi-objective WAP in a Pareto sense. The benefits of exploiting MLWs are also illustrated.","['METAL', 'ME', 'MATH']",multi objective worker allocation optimisation in a multiple u line system emerald publishing limit purpose this paper aim to evaluate two operational mode of the worker allocation problem wap in the multiple u line system mul five objective be optimise simultaneously for the most complicated operational mode I e machine dominant working and fix station walk besides the benefit of use multiline workstation mlws be investigate design methodology approach the elite non dominate sort differential evolutionary iii ensde iii algorithm be develop as a solution technique also the large remain available time heuristic be propose as a baseline in determine the number and utilisation of worker when the use of mlws be not allow finding ensde iii outperform the cutting edge multi objective evolutionary algorithm I e multi objective evolutionary algorithm base on decomposition and non dominate sort differential evolutionary iii under two key pareto metric I e generational distance and invert generational distance regardless of the problem size the well find number of worker from ensde iii be substantially low than the upper bind the mul with mlws require few worker than the one without research limitation implication although this research have extend several issue in the basic model of multiple u line system some assumption be use to facilitate mathematical computation as follow the u line system in this research assume that all line be produce only a single product besides all worker be well train to gain the same skill these assumption could be extend in the future practical implication the implication of this research be the benefit of multiline workstation mlws use in the multiple u line system instead of leave each individual line to operate independently all line should be work in parallel through the use of mlws to gain benefit in term of worker reduction balance worker s workload high system utilisation originality value this research be the first to address the wap in the mul with machine dominant working and fix station walk mode worker s fatigue due to stand and walk while work be incorporate into the model the novel ensde iii algorithm be develop to optimise the multi objective wap in a pareto sense the benefit of exploit mlws be also illustrate

However, the pictures within a group of picture (GOP) are quite similar to each other, where the existing rate control, R-Lambda rate control, cannot address correctly. Hence, we propose the R-Lambda coefficient distribution in the latest video coding standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), to enhance the prediction of encoder control. The experimental results show the proposed algorithm can accomplish slightly better video perceptual quality of the reconstructed video than the original rate control in HEVC reference software (HM-16.10).","['EE', 'IE']",encoder control enhancement in hevc base on r lambda coefficient distribution ieee encoder control know as rate control have be develop in the video code standard to obtain the consistent video perceptual quality for various video application however the picture within a group of picture gop be quite similar to each other where the exist rate control r lambda rate control can not address correctly hence we propose the r lambda coefficient distribution in the late video code standard high efficiency video code hevc to enhance the prediction of encoder control the experimental result show the propose algorithm can accomplish slightly well video perceptual quality of the reconstructed video than the original rate control in hevc reference software hm
219,Investigation of Leukocyte Viability in A Setup of Spiral Microchannel for Cell Sorting Application,"© 2018 IEEE.Recently, a spiral microchannel has been receiving remarkable attentions in a field of biology for cell separation. Because it could separate different sizes of cells and has potential to integrate together with other components for a biological study of a single cell. However, hydrodynamic forces in spiral section and other components could potentially cause cell to death and change in cell physical and biological properties, but there was rarely such study so far. Therefore, the investigation of cell viability in a setup of spiral microchannel including feeding system and spiral microchannel was performed in this work. Beside the cell viability investigation, the change in cell morphology and intracellular structures were also investigated. The results indicated that stresses - extensional and shear stresses might be the important factors affecting cell death.

220,Undrained Stability of Unlined Square Tunnels in Clays with Linearly Increasing Anisotropic Shear Strength,"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.In general, the undrained strength anisotropy of clays is found in nature. Its effect on a stability problem during undrained loading should be considered in order to get a more accurate and realistic safety assessment. In this paper, the undrained stability of unlined square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays is investigated by the lower bound finite element limit analysis using second-order cone programming. The anisotropic undrained strength of clays is modelled by using an elliptical strength envelope under plane strain conditions. The stability analyses of the problem are performed by the comprehensive investigations of the effects of the cover-depth ratio, the normalized overburden pressure, the normalized strength gradient, and the anisotropic strength ratio on the stability load factor and associated failure mechanisms. The computed lower bound solutions are validated with the existing results of square tunnels in isotropic clays. The new approximate equations of the stability load factor and factor of safety for square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays are first time presented by using a nonlinear regression, hence providing a reliable, accurate and convenient tool for stability analyses of the problem in practice. The numerical results reveal that the strength anisotropy has a significant impact on the stability load factor, especially when anisotropic clays have much difference in undrained strengths between compression and extension.","['SAFETY', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",undrained stability of unlined square tunnel in clay with linearly increase anisotropic shear strength springer nature switzerland ag in general the undrained strength anisotropy of clay be find in nature its effect on a stability problem during undrained loading should be consider in order to get a more accurate and realistic safety assessment in this paper the undrained stability of unlined square tunnel in anisotropic and non homogeneous clay be investigate by the lower bind finite element limit analysis use second order cone programming the anisotropic undrained strength of clay be model by use an elliptical strength envelope under plane strain condition the stability analysis of the problem be perform by the comprehensive investigation of the effect of the cover depth ratio the normalize overburden pressure the normalize strength gradient and the anisotropic strength ratio on the stability load factor and associate failure mechanism the compute low bind solution be validate with the exist result of square tunnel in isotropic clay the new approximate equation of the stability load factor and factor of safety for square tunnel in anisotropic and non homogeneous clay be first time present by use a nonlinear regression hence provide a reliable accurate and convenient tool for stability analysis of the problem in practice the numerical result reveal that the strength anisotropy have a significant impact on the stability load factor especially when anisotropic clay have much difference in undrained strength between compression and extension

Particular focus was put on the use of different product separation techniques, including solvent extraction using ethyl acetate, benzene, organic nanofiltration, and adsorption by zeolite. The performance of each proposed process was evaluated in terms of energy consumption, process economics, and environmental impacts. Simulation of the vanillin production processes was performed using the Aspen Plus program while the economic and environmental analyses were conducted using economic analysis tools and LCSoft, respectively. The results revealed that the process using adsorption by zeolite is the best alternative. It offered a slight improvement in energy consumption while its economic result showed 7.37% improvement. It also caused the least environmental impact in all categories.","['ENV', 'PE', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'IE']",comparison of different kraft lignin base vanillin production process elsevier ltdthis work employ a systematic methodology and process intensification concept to improve the state of the art vanillin production process from kraft lignin particular focus be put on the use of different product separation technique include solvent extraction use ethyl acetate benzene organic nanofiltration and adsorption by zeolite the performance of each propose process be evaluate in term of energy consumption process economic and environmental impact simulation of the vanillin production process be perform use the aspen plus program while the economic and environmental analysis be conduct use economic analysis tool and lcsoft respectively the result reveal that the process use adsorption by zeolite be the good alternative it offer a slight improvement in energy consumption while its economic result show improvement it also cause the least environmental impact in all category

223,Electrochemical bicarbonate reduction in the presence of Diisopropylamine on sliver oxide in alkaline sodium bicarbonate medium,"© 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.In this study, the reduction of bicarbonate in the presence four amines on a silver oxide/ carbon nanotube (Ag2O/CNT) composite electrode has been investigated. The studied amines includes ethanolamine (MEA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), diisopropylamine (DIPA) and aminoethylpiperazine (AEP). Regardless of amine type, in the absence of a bicarbonate solution, no reduction/oxidation peaks were observed. However, in the presence of bicarbonate, a single reduction peak along with simultaneous H2 evolution was clearly observed. The cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that only diisopropylamine (DIPA) had a significant catalytic effect toward bicarbonate reduction on the composite electrode. No peak was observed in the anodic direction of the reverse scans, suggesting the irreversible nature of the electrochemical process. The effect of scan rate revealed that the irreversible reduction mechanism is governed by both diffusion and adsorption pathways. In addition of carbonate ions, format ions also have been detected in liquid phase. In order to study the mechanism of bicarbonate reduction in the DIPA solution on Ag2O/CNT electrode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. The EIS results showed that the charge transfer resistance decreased when the potential decreased from -0.1 to -0.9 V then faded with a further rise in potential to up to -1.9 V. In addition, an inductive loop under certain conditions was observed in the complex plane due to the formation of adsorbed intermediates onto the electrode surface.","['NANO', 'CHE']",electrochemical bicarbonate reduction in the presence of diisopropylamine on sliver oxide in alkaline sodium bicarbonate medium publish by elsevi ltd in this study the reduction of bicarbonate in the presence four amine on a silver oxide carbon nanotube ag o cnt composite electrode have be investigate the studied amine include ethanolamine mea diethylenetriamine deta diisopropylamine dipa and aminoethylpiperazine aep regardless of amine type in the absence of a bicarbonate solution no reduction oxidation peak be observe however in the presence of bicarbonate a single reduction peak along with simultaneous h evolution be clearly observe the cyclic voltammetry measurement show that only diisopropylamine dipa have a significant catalytic effect toward bicarbonate reduction on the composite electrode no peak be observe in the anodic direction of the reverse scan suggest the irreversible nature of the electrochemical process the effect of scan rate reveal that the irreversible reduction mechanism be govern by both diffusion and adsorption pathway in addition of carbonate ion format ion also have be detect in liquid phase in order to study the mechanism of bicarbonate reduction in the dipa solution on ag o cnt electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis be employ the eis result show that the charge transfer resistance decrease when the potential decrease from to v then fade with a further rise in potential to up to v in addition an inductive loop under certain condition be observe in the complex plane due to the formation of adsorbed intermediate onto the electrode surface
224,Formation of Alpha-Case Layer During Investment Casting of Pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V Using Comparative XRD and EXAFS Investigation,"© 2019, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.In titanium casting, a reaction byproduct known as alpha-case is a hard and brittle phase layer that exists on the surface of cast objects. This reaction layer may be detrimental to the mechanical properties of cast objects and may complicate the finishing processes. To investigate the formation of the alpha-case layer during the casting of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy, both metal ingots were cast in spinel-based investments in a controlled environment. The cast samples were metallographically prepared and analyzed for the thicknesses of alpha-case layer depth and the metal matrix. The samples were characterized using light microscopy, Vickers microhardness testing, X-ray diffractometry, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectrometry. The alpha-case layer on the CP-Ti cast sample was thicker than that of the Ti-6Al-4V cast sample due to the ability of the α-titanium matrix to uptake oxygen faster, which in turn is attributed to the higher diffusion coefficient of the α-titanium phase. A metastable Ti3O phase was observed as an intermediate reaction product which could be transformed into the alpha-case layer and the α-titanium phase.","['METAL', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",formation of alpha case layer during investment casting of pure ti and ti al v use comparative xrd and exafs investigation the mineral metal material society and asm international in titanium cast a reaction byproduct know as alpha case be a hard and brittle phase layer that exist on the surface of cast object this reaction layer may be detrimental to the mechanical property of cast object and may complicate the finish process to investigate the formation of the alpha case layer during the casting of commercially pure titanium cp ti and ti al v alloy both metal ingot be cast in spinel base investment in a control environment the cast sample be metallographically prepare and analyze for the thickness of alpha case layer depth and the metal matrix the sample be characterize use light microscopy vicker microhardness testing x ray diffractometry and extended x ray absorption fine structure spectrometry the alpha case layer on the cp ti cast sample be thick than that of the ti al v cast sample due to the ability of the α titanium matrix to uptake oxygen fast which in turn be attribute to the high diffusion coefficient of the α titanium phase a metastable ti o phase be observe as an intermediate reaction product which could be transform into the alpha case layer and the α titanium phase

226,Comparison of electron temperature in DC glow discharge and AC glow discharge plasma,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Knowing electron temperature and electron density is important for any plasma related applications. In this research, the electron temperature and electron density of argon plasma generated by low frequency AC power supply and a high voltage DC power supply were investigated. The measurements were compared, both experimentally and theoretically. For the experiment, a long glass cylindrical tube was used as a chamber where the electrodes were placed at 37.5 cm apart. A high voltage function generator power supply was operated at various frequencies and it was also used for DC operation. The electron temperatures were measured by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) technique for different operating pressures of 0.1 mbar, 0.6 mbar and 1.1 mbar. For the simulation, both plasma theory and finite element method were used to simulate dynamics of the plasma in the cylindrical setup. From the experiment, the range of breakdown voltage was found to be between 0.80 to 2.3 kV. The length of DC glow discharge dark regions of the plasma decreases due to increasing in both operating pressure and voltage. AC glow discharge shows positive charge and negative charge swing. From the DC discharge, the maximum value of electron temperature was found to be 0.810 eV and the minimum value was 0.610 eV under the operating pressure 0.1 and 0.6 mbar respectively. From AC glow discharge plasma, the maximum electron temperature was 0.907 eV and the minimum was 0.540 eV under operating pressure 0.1 and 1.1 mbar respectively. Collision loss between ions and electrons causes this variation in the results.","['EE', 'MATSCI']",comparison of electron temperature in dc glow discharge and ac glow discharge plasma publish under licence by iop publish ltd knowing electron temperature and electron density be important for any plasma relate application in this research the electron temperature and electron density of argon plasma generate by low frequency ac power supply and a high voltage dc power supply be investigate the measurement be compare both experimentally and theoretically for the experiment a long glass cylindrical tube be use as a chamber where the electrode be place at cm apart a high voltage function generator power supply be operate at various frequency and it be also use for dc operation the electron temperature be measure by optical emission spectroscopy oes technique for different operating pressure of mbar mbar and mbar for the simulation both plasma theory and finite element method be use to simulate dynamic of the plasma in the cylindrical setup from the experiment the range of breakdown voltage be find to be between to kv the length of dc glow discharge dark region of the plasma decrease due to increase in both operating pressure and voltage ac glow discharge show positive charge and negative charge swing from the dc discharge the maximum value of electron temperature be find to be ev and the minimum value be ev under the operating pressure and mbar respectively from ac glow discharge plasma the maximum electron temperature be ev and the minimum be ev under operating pressure and mbar respectively collision loss between ion and electron cause this variation in the result
227,Design and function of a nitrogen and sediment removal system in a recirculating aquaculture system optimized for aquaponics,"© 2021 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.Aquaponic systems (APSs) are based upon the sustainable utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus from a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) as the nutrient source for plant production. Since the proper management of nitrogen and suspended solids are important for nutrient utilization efficiency, their optimization was evaluated. The RAS integrated with filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter provided complete nitrification without solid accumulation. Under the optimal treatment condition for 16 d, the treated water was low in ammonia (0 mg-N/L) and high in nitrate (> 6 mg-N/L) concentrations, which was appropriate for use in the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The RAS was then incorporated with hydroponics at a 5:1 fish: plant weight ratio. Moreover, the simplified APS was compared with a typical APS system that incorporated filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter. The natural growth of nitrifying microorganisms in the simplified APS could perform complete nitrification after 20 d of operation giving low ammonia and nitrite concentrations. The nutrient removal efficiency of the simplified APS resembled the typical system. During the aquaponics, the hydroponic unit in the aquaculture system was sufficient to control the nutrient concentrations within the appropriate levels for fish cultivation, i.e. nitrate (< 20 mg-N/L) and phosphate (< 3 mg-P/L).","['ENV', 'CHE', 'AGRI', 'IE']",design and function of a nitrogen and sediment removal system in a recirculating aquaculture system optimize for aquaponic korean society of environmental engineer aquaponic system apss be base upon the sustainable utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus from a recirculating aquaculture system ras as the nutrient source for plant production since the proper management of nitrogen and suspend solid be important for nutrient utilization efficiency their optimization be evaluate the ras integrate with filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter provide complete nitrification without solid accumulation under the optimal treatment condition for d the treat water be low in ammonia mg n l and high in nitrate mg n l concentration which be appropriate for use in the cultivation of lettuce lactuca sativa the ras be then incorporate with hydroponic at a fish plant weight ratio moreover the simplified aps be compare with a typical aps system that incorporate filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter the natural growth of nitrify microorganism in the simplify aps could perform complete nitrification after d of operation give low ammonia and nitrite concentration the nutrient removal efficiency of the simplify aps resemble the typical system during the aquaponic the hydroponic unit in the aquaculture system be sufficient to control the nutrient concentration within the appropriate level for fish cultivation I e nitrate mg n l and phosphate mg p l
228,Stress intensity factor for wide-flange steel member with crack surface interference,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents a physically acceptable analysis of stress intensity factor (SIF) for a two-tip web crack in the wide-flange (W shape) steel member widely used in steel construction subjected to the linear distribution loading. The analysis includes the effect of crack surface interference, i.e., crack surfaces are not allowed to overlap, that magnifies the SIF and crack opening displacement (COD) in an opened portion of the crack. For a range of possible web cracks in typical hot-rolled W shapes listed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual, the effective mode-I SIF is a function of applied stress, web crack length, crack eccentricity, and flange-to-web area ratio of the W shape. The depth-to-width ratio of W shape is not a significant parameter in the calculation of SIF. The analysis results show that the conventional (overlapping) solution underestimates the SIF at the tension-side crack tip under bending up to 12%. The effect of crack surface interference only exists between the conditions for complete crack opening and complete crack closure. Both conditions are governed by axial-to-bending stress ratio.","['CE', 'ME', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",stress intensity factor for wide flange steel member with crack surface interference elsevier ltdthis paper present a physically acceptable analysis of stress intensity factor sif for a two tip web crack in the wide flange w shape steel member widely use in steel construction subject to the linear distribution load the analysis include the effect of crack surface interference I e crack surface be not allow to overlap that magnifie the sif and crack opening displacement cod in an open portion of the crack for a range of possible web crack in typical hot roll w shape list in the aisc steel construction manual the effective mode I sif be a function of apply stress web crack length crack eccentricity and flange to web area ratio of the w shape the depth to width ratio of w shape be not a significant parameter in the calculation of sif the analysis result show that the conventional overlapping solution underestimate the sif at the tension side crack tip under bend up to the effect of crack surface interference only exist between the condition for complete crack opening and complete crack closure both condition be govern by axial to bend stress ratio
229,Comparing Filtering Techniques in Restaurant Recommendation System,"© 2018 IEEE.This paper studies the key analytics of the restaurant recommendation system, namely predicting restaurant satisfaction rating based on customer and restaurant characteristics. As food industry grows and offers more variety of restaurants, customers generally have difficulty discovering a restaurant that suits or satisfies them. This paper aims to predict restaurant satisfaction rating based on three methodologies: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering. For content-based filtering, this paper proposes using regression to create a prediction model from customer and restaurant characteristics. For collaborative filtering, our proposed model employs a combination of cluster analysis, similarity test, and weighted sum in order to analyze factors that influence the satisfaction rating.

231,Innovative seawater uranium recovery agent based on low-cost polyacrylonitrile fibers,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdAn innovative seawater uranium adsorbent was prepared from the low-cost and commercially-available polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The optimum condition to synthesize the adsorbent was to irradiate the PAN fibers with 100 kGy gamma ray, amidoximate in 3 (w/v)% hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution for 75 min at 75 °C, yielding the PAN nitrile group conversion of approximately 60%. At 100 kGy, the degree of crystallinity of the irradiated fibers was also highest at 79.1%. The performances of the adsorbent in seawater samples were excellent. By submersion in the seawater sample spiked with 250 ppb of uranium for 4 weeks, the prepared fibers exhibited the adsorption capacity of 32.28 mg/g adsorbent. By submersion in seawater samples spiked with 76.5 ppm of uranium for 1 week and 945 ppm of uranium for up to 4 weeks, the fibers exhibited the adsorption capacities of 111.25 and 200.07 mg/g adsorbent, respectively. The adsorbent showed a uranium adsorption capacity of 0.11 mg/g adsorbent for 8 weeks of soaking in brine concentrate from a seawater reverse osmosis plant. The kinetics of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 300% in 5 min or less. Another important finding was that the prepared PAN fibers exhibit the characteristics of a superabsorbent material (equilibrium swelling ratio in DI water of 5,550%). The low cost and the ease of preparation of the fibers offer a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ions released into seawater following a nuclear accident.","['METAL', 'CHE', 'IE', 'MATSCI']",innovative seawater uranium recovery agent base on low cost polyacrylonitrile fiber elsevi ltdan innovative seawater uranium adsorbent be prepare from the low cost and commercially available polyacrylonitrile pan fiber the optimum condition to synthesize the adsorbent be to irradiate the pan fiber with kgy gamma ray amidoximate in w v hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution for min at c yield the pan nitrile group conversion of approximately at kgy the degree of crystallinity of the irradiate fiber be also high at the performance of the adsorbent in seawater sample be excellent by submersion in the seawater sample spike with ppb of uranium for week the prepared fiber exhibit the adsorption capacity of mg g adsorbent by submersion in seawater sample spike with ppm of uranium for week and ppm of uranium for up to week the fiber exhibit the adsorption capacity of and mg g adsorbent respectively the adsorbent show a uranium adsorption capacity of mg g adsorbent for week of soak in brine concentrate from a seawater reverse osmosis plant the kinetic of seawater absorption by the adsorbent be quite rapid reach the equilibrium swell ratio of approximately in min or less another important finding be that the prepared pan fiber exhibit the characteristic of a superabsorbent material equilibrium swell ratio in di water of the low cost and the ease of preparation of the fiber offer a novel environmental remediation process to adsorb uranium ion release into seawater follow a nuclear accident

233,Lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming,"Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.In this paper, the formulation of the lower bound limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion using second-order cone programming is described. The finite element concept was used to discretize the soil mass into 3-noded triangular elements. The stress field was modeled using a linear interpolation within the elements while stress discontinuities were permitted to occur at the shared edges of adjacent elements. An elliptical yield criterion was adopted to model the anisotropic undrained strength of the clay. A statically admissible stress field was defined by enforcing the equilibrium equations within all triangular elements and along all shared edges of adjacent elements, stress boundary conditions, and no stress violation of the anisotropic strength envelope cast in the form of a conic quadratic constraint. The lower bound solution of the proposed formulation was solved by second-order cone programming. The proposed formulation of the anisotropic undrained strength criterion was validated through comparison of the model's predictions with the known exact solutions of strip footings, and was applied to solve undrained stability of a shallow unlined square tunnel. Computational performance between the proposed approach of second-order cone programming and linear programming was examined and discussed.","['MATH', 'MATSCI']",lower bind limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion use second order cone programming copyright john wiley sons ltd in this paper the formulation of the lower bind limit analysis of an anisotropic undrained strength criterion use second order cone programming be describe the finite element concept be use to discretize the soil mass into noded triangular element the stress field be model use a linear interpolation within the element while stress discontinuity be permit to occur at the share edge of adjacent element an elliptical yield criterion be adopt to model the anisotropic undrained strength of the clay a statically admissible stress field be define by enforce the equilibrium equation within all triangular element and along all share edge of adjacent element stress boundary condition and no stress violation of the anisotropic strength envelope cast in the form of a conic quadratic constraint the lower bind solution of the propose formulation be solve by second order cone program the propose formulation of the anisotropic undrained strength criterion be validate through comparison of the model s prediction with the know exact solution of strip footing and be apply to solve undrained stability of a shallow unlined square tunnel computational performance between the propose approach of second order cone programming and linear programming be examine and discuss
234,Investigation of the Morphology of InSb/InAs Quantum Nanostripe Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimThe dimensions and morphologies of quantum nanostructures are keys to controlling an operating wavelength to a desirable wavelength range due to the quantum effect. The dimension and morphology evolutions of InSb/InAs quantum nanostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy with respect to the number of InSb monolayers (MLs) are investigated. The formation of the quantum nanostructures is dominated by lateral growth, in which the morphology is further elongated as the number of MLs is increased. Such an anisotropic growth is explained by the difference in the surface energy along each direction, which corresponds to different atomic arrangements in the crystalline structure of InSb. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic images show a reduction in the lateral dimension and an increase in the height of the embedded InSb quantum nanostructures when they are embedded in the InAs matrix. The results herein provide a means for obtaining the precise control over dimensions and morphologies of the InSb/InAs nanostructures, which is essential for extending the operating wavelength further into the mid-infrared region.","['EE', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",investigation of the morphology of insb inas quantum nanostripe grow by molecular beam epitaxy wiley vch verlag gmbh co kgaa weinheimthe dimension and morphology of quantum nanostructure be key to control an operating wavelength to a desirable wavelength range due to the quantum effect the dimension and morphology evolution of insb inas quantum nanostructure grow by molecular beam epitaxy with respect to the number of insb monolayer mls be investigate the formation of the quantum nanostructure be dominate by lateral growth in which the morphology be far elongate as the number of mls be increase such an anisotropic growth be explain by the difference in the surface energy along each direction which correspond to different atomic arrangement in the crystalline structure of insb cross sectional transmission electron microscopic image show a reduction in the lateral dimension and an increase in the height of the embed insb quantum nanostructure when they be embed in the inas matrix the result herein provide a means for obtain the precise control over dimension and morphology of the insb inas nanostructure which be essential for extend the operating wavelength far into the mid infrared region
235,A review of feature extraction and performance evaluation in epileptic seizure detection using EEG,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdSince the manual detection of electrographic seizures in continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is very time-consuming and requires a trained expert, attempts to develop automatic seizure detection are diverse and ongoing. Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features, data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions, making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features – variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG signal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on wavelet coefficients – were able to significantly capture the seizures. When compared with a baseline method of classifying all epochs as normal, an improvement of 4.77–13.51% in the Bayesian error was obtained.","['BME', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATH']",a review of feature extraction and performance evaluation in epileptic seizure detection use eeg elsevi ltdsince the manual detection of electrographic seizure in continuous electroencephalogram eeg monitoring be very time consume and require a train expert attempt to develop automatic seizure detection be diverse and ongoing machine learning approach be intensely be apply to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure condition from a large amount of datum and provide pre screen result for neurologist several feature datum transformation and classifier have be explore to analyze and classify seizure via eeg signal in the literature some jointly apply feature use in the classification may have share similar contribution make they redundant in the learning process therefore this paper aim to comprehensively summarize feature description and their interpretation in characterize epileptic seizure use eeg signal as well as to review classification performance metric to provide meaningful information of feature selection we conduct an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently the bayesian error and non parametric probability distribution estimation be employ to determine the significance of the individual feature moreover a redundancy analysis use a correlation base feature selection be apply the result show that the follow features variance energy nonlinear energy and shannon entropy compute on a raw eeg signal as well as variance energy kurtosis and line length calculate on wavelet coefficient be able to significantly capture the seizure when compare with a baseline method of classify all epoch as normal an improvement of in the bayesian error be obtain
236,Antral contraction rate estimation from dynamic antral scintigraphy using Hilbert-Huang transform,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdConventional analysis of the gastric antral contraction rate (ACR) utilizes the Fourier transform (FT) which does not effectively capture the non-stationary property of dynamic antral scintigraphy (DAS). In this study, we showed that application of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) on DAS yielded better estimates of ACR. Specifically, the time activity curves were extracted from the DAS data of 18 healthy volunteers and subjected to FT and HHT analyses. Comparison of the mean, standard deviation (SD), and root mean square error (RMSE) of ACR estimated by both methods showed that the proposed HHT method yielded significantly smaller SD (p<0.00001), smaller relative SD (13.3% versus 53.7%) and RMSE (0.72 cpm versus 1.59 cpm). Moreover, the HHT method also achieved lower relative SD of the frequency values from the intrinsic mode functions. Overall results indicated that the HHT method outperformed the conventional FT method in estimating the ACR from DAS. We anticipate that our approach will lead to development of effective noninvasive diagnoses of gastrointestinal tract diseases using DAS.","['BME', 'EE', 'MATH']",antral contraction rate estimation from dynamic antral scintigraphy use hilbert huang transform elsevi ltdconventional analysis of the gastric antral contraction rate acr utilize the fouri transform ft which do not effectively capture the non stationary property of dynamic antral scintigraphy da in this study we show that application of hilbert huang transform hht on das yield well estimate of acr specifically the time activity curve be extract from the das datum of healthy volunteer and subject to ft and hht analyse comparison of the mean standard deviation sd and root mean square error rmse of acr estimate by both method show that the propose hht method yield significantly small sd p small relative sd versus and rmse cpm versus cpm moreover the hht method also achieve low relative sd of the frequency value from the intrinsic mode function overall result indicate that the hht method outperform the conventional ft method in estimate the acr from das we anticipate that our approach will lead to development of effective noninvasive diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract disease use das

The artifact leads to the information loss. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is not affected by this artifact. In this paper, we propose using the information from MR images to reproduces the information lost due to dental filling in CT images. First, we register the CT and MR images of the same patient. Then, we classify the skull into 3 regions: teeth, tissue near the teeth and others. For teeth and tissue near the teeth, we develop the mapping function between the intensity in the MR image to the mean intensity in the CT image. The pixels corrupted by the metal artifact are detected and their intensity are changed according to the mapping function with its MR intensity as the input. The proposed method significantly removed metal artifacts and could be used to improve the diagnosis and planning accuracy.","['CE', 'BME', 'EE', 'CPE', 'OPTIC']",metal artifact reduction by map mr into ct information ieee one of the fundamental noise in compute tomography ct imaging be metal artifact the artifact lead to the information loss magnetic resonance mr imaging be not affect by this artifact in this paper we propose use the information from mr image to reproduce the information lose due to dental filling in ct image first we register the ct and mr image of the same patient then we classify the skull into region tooth tissue near the tooth and other for tooth and tissue near the tooth we develop the mapping function between the intensity in the mr image to the mean intensity in the ct image the pixel corrupt by the metal artifact be detect and their intensity be change accord to the mapping function with its mr intensity as the input the propose method significantly remove metal artifact and could be use to improve the diagnosis and planning accuracy
239,Bio-based production of carbon nanotubes via co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus oil and ferrocene,"© 2021To comply with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), bio-based production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was investigated using co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus oil and ferrocene instead of non-valorizable petroleum-based hydrocarbons. Attributed to high carbon content of eucalyptus oil, CNTs with substantial yield could be produced within a pyrolyzing temperature (Tp) range of 800−900 °C and different molar ratios of eucalyptus oil to ferrocene (Rof) including 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. Typical FESEM analyses of as-produced CNTs revealed that CNTs with agglomeration of amorphous carbon could be produced at low Tp and low Rof. Meanwhile higher Tp and Rof could provide CNTs with lower content of amorphous carbon. TGA analyses could confirm the superior thermal stability of the resultant CNTs which were produced at high Tp and Rof. The highest CNT yield of about 45 % was obtained at Tp of 850 °C and Rof of 1:1. It could be confirmed that Tp of 900 °C and Rof of 3:1 was the optimal condition for production of high quality CNTs from valorizable eucalyptus oil.","['ME', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",bio base production of carbon nanotube via co pyrolysis of eucalyptus oil and ferrocene to comply with the sustainable development goal sdgs bio base production of carbon nanotube cnt be investigate use co pyrolysis of eucalyptus oil and ferrocene instead of non valorizable petroleum base hydrocarbon attribute to high carbon content of eucalyptus oil cnt with substantial yield could be produce within a pyrolyze temperature tp range of c and different molar ratio of eucalyptus oil to ferrocene rof include and typical fesem analysis of as produce cnt reveal that cnt with agglomeration of amorphous carbon could be produce at low tp and low rof meanwhile high tp and rof could provide cnt with low content of amorphous carbon tga analysis could confirm the superior thermal stability of the resultant cnt which be produce at high tp and rof the high cnt yield of about be obtain at tp of c and rof of it could be confirm that tp of c and rof of be the optimal condition for production of high quality cnt from valorizable eucalyptus oil

241,Identification of zinc-ion battery via equivalent circuit model,"© 2019 IEEE.It is notable that zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) show an up-and-coming trend to replace Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in the future. As yet, no intensive study has provided measurable recognition of this trend. Nevertheless, the present work sets out to find a prototype to validate the above trend towards the use of zinc-ion batteries. To this end, both the traditional equivalentcircuit model (ECM) combined with the recursive least squares (RLS) method were employed to identify such a model. Hence, the model was obtained via hybrid pulse power characterization test on a laboratory-scale battery. Results demonstrated excellent compatibility of this strategy to the dynamics of the ZIB. This can lead, therefore, to efficient battery-state prediction. The strategy can also benefit battery management system (BMS) development.","['METAL', 'EE', 'CPE', 'MATH']",identification of zinc ion battery via equivalent circuit model ieee it be notable that zinc ion battery zib show an up and come trend to replace li ion battery lib in the future as yet no intensive study have provide measurable recognition of this trend nevertheless the present work set out to find a prototype to validate the above trend towards the use of zinc ion battery to this end both the traditional equivalentcircuit model ecm combine with the recursive least square rls method be employ to identify such a model hence the model be obtain via hybrid pulse power characterization test on a laboratory scale battery result demonstrate excellent compatibility of this strategy to the dynamic of the zib this can lead therefore to efficient battery state prediction the strategy can also benefit battery management system bms development

The solid mixtures consisted of Ni-based catalyst and CaO sorbent. The aim of study was to design a proper pilot-scale CFB riser which produced hydrogen (H2) with both high purity and high flux. The design parameters and the reaction parameters were examined with 2k full factorial design. The significances of each parameter were analyzed by analysis of variance. Using the optimum result, the highest H2 purity reached 98.58% in dry basis accompanied with the highest H2 flux of 0.301 kg/m2 s. The hydrodynamics of this optimum case showed that SESMR was nearly completed since 5.0 m height because axial and radial distributions of solid were well developed without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent. Thus, the H2 purity and the H2 flux approached fully developed within the riser height.","['PE', 'CPE', 'CHE']",parametric study of hydrogen production via sorption enhance steam methane reform in a circulate fluidize bed riser elsevi ltdcomputational fluid dynamic be apply for sorption enhance steam methane reform sesmr operate in a circulate fluidize bed cfb riser the solid mixture consist of ni base catalyst and cao sorbent the aim of study be to design a proper pilot scale cfb riser which produce hydrogen h with both high purity and high flux the design parameter and the reaction parameter be examine with k full factorial design the significance of each parameter be analyze by analysis of variance use the optimum result the high h purity reach in dry basis accompany with the high h flux of kg m s the hydrodynamic of this optimum case show that sesmr be nearly complete since m height because axial and radial distribution of solid be well develop without excessive segregation between catalyst and sorbent thus the h purity and the h flux approach fully develop within the riser height
243,Food Image Categorization Using Attentional Bilinear Model,"© 2019 IEEE.Nowadays, many food images are posted on various social network platforms without identification labels. An automatic food categorization application would greatly help to identify and classify food categories. Food categorization is a complex problem since the number of category types can be more than one hundred. Many kinds of food are similar with only subtle differences in taste and presentation and this can lead to a problem called 'finegrained issue'. Recently, a bilinear model was employed which showed good accuracy and generated excessive features to capture details among different food categories, albeit with limited performance. Diverse food categories require disparate sets of features. Here, an attention mechanism was applied to capture suitable features and specifically identify each food category. Furthermore, the performance of a bilinear backbone was also enhanced by applying Inception in correlation with Inception-ResNet-v2 and Inception-v3 networks. The experiment was conducted on the Wongnai dataset containing various images that were separated into 83 classes. Results showed that our attentional model outperformed the traditional bilinear model, with an average of 16% improvement showing 3% and 44% as min-max performance values, respectively.",['AGRI'],food image categorization use attentional bilinear model ieee nowadays many food image be post on various social network platform without identification label an automatic food categorization application would greatly help to identify and classify food category food categorization be a complex problem since the number of category type can be more than one hundred many kind of food be similar with only subtle difference in taste and presentation and this can lead to a problem call finegraine issue recently a bilinear model be employ which show good accuracy and generate excessive feature to capture detail among different food category albeit with limited performance diverse food category require disparate set of feature here an attention mechanism be apply to capture suitable feature and specifically identify each food category furthermore the performance of a bilinear backbone be also enhance by apply inception in correlation with inception resnet v and inception v network the experiment be conduct on the wongnai dataset contain various image that be separate into class result show that our attentional model outperform the traditional bilinear model with an average of improvement showing and as min max performance value respectively
244,Transportation of part supply improvement in agricultural machinery assembly plant,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.This research focused on the problem caused by the transportation of part supply in agricultural machinery assembly plant in Thailand, which is one of the processes that are critical to the whole production process. If poorly managed, it will affect transportation of part supply, the emergence of sink cost, quality problems, and the ability to respond to the needs of the customers in time. Since the competition in the agricultural machinery market is more intense, the efficiency of part transportation process has to be improved. In this study, the process of transporting parts of the plant was studied and it was found that the efficiency of the process of transporting parts from the sub assembly line to its main assembly line was 83%. The approach to the performance improvement is done by using the Lean tool to limit wastes based on the ECRS principle and applying pull production system by changing the transportation method to operate as milkrun for transportation of parts to synchronize with the part demands of the main assembly line. After the transportation of parts from sub-Assembly line to the main assembly line was improved, the efficiency raised to 98% and transportation process cost was saved to 540,000 Baht per year.","['ME', 'AGRI', 'IE']",transportation of part supply improvement in agricultural machinery assembly plant publish under licence by iop publish ltd this research focus on the problem cause by the transportation of part supply in agricultural machinery assembly plant in thailand which be one of the process that be critical to the whole production process if poorly manage it will affect transportation of part supply the emergence of sink cost quality problem and the ability to respond to the need of the customer in time since the competition in the agricultural machinery market be more intense the efficiency of part transportation process have to be improve in this study the process of transport part of the plant be study and it be find that the efficiency of the process of transport part from the sub assembly line to its main assembly line be the approach to the performance improvement be do by use the lean tool to limit waste base on the ecrs principle and apply pull production system by change the transportation method to operate as milkrun for transportation of part to synchronize with the part demand of the main assembly line after the transportation of part from sub assembly line to the main assembly line be improve the efficiency raise to and transportation process cost be save to baht per year

246,Semantic segmentation on remotely sensed images using an enhanced global convolutional network with channel attention and domain specific transfer learning,"© 2019 by the authors.In the remote sensing domain, it is crucial to complete semantic segmentation on the raster images, e.g., river, building, forest, etc., on raster images. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder (DCED) network is the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method for remotely sensed images. However, the accuracy is still limited, since the network is not designed for remotely sensed images and the training data in this domain is deficient. In this paper, we aim to propose a novel CNN for semantic segmentation particularly for remote sensing corpora with three main contributions. First, we propose applying a recent CNN called a global convolutional network (GCN), since it can capture different resolutions by extracting multi-scale features from different stages of the network. Additionally, we further enhance the network by improving its backbone using larger numbers of layers, which is suitable for medium resolution remotely sensed images. Second, ""channel attention"" is presented in our network in order to select the most discriminative filters (features).

247,Enhancing performance of maintenance in solar power plant,"© 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enhance the performance of maintenance in a solar power plant by implementing the proactive maintenance (PaM) strategy, measured by the availability and the total maintenance workload. Design/methodology/approach: The prior maintenance strategy was reviewed, and then the strategy was adjusted to focus on PaM. Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) was a tool for analyzing the severity and occurrence of the failure modes and effects. Then, the Why‒Why analysis was used for investigating the root causes of failures. The countermeasures were drawn, and the preventive maintenance (PM) plan was revised and carried out. The total maintenance, the PaM and reactive maintenance workload, was obtained, and then the improvements were determined. The values of availability were also obtained. Findings: Previously, the appeared maintenance strategy was not clearly defined. It seemed to have reactive maintenance coupled with PM; it was checked once a year, and corrective actions were made when something wrong was found. Then the management team observed an increase in the reactive maintenance workload, whereas the values of availability were not consistent and tended to drop. After implementing the new maintenance strategy, PaM, the total maintenance workload decreased 14 percent in one year. The average availability of the solar power plant improved from 0.9943 to 0.9969, and the values of availability had better consistency. Practical implications: The PaM can be applied to solar power plant without limiting the prior maintenance strategy and the complexity of production or machinery. The solar power plant is a quite simple production, and most machines consist of electrical equipment and electrical circuits. The PaM supports to analyze the failure modes, the consequence of the failure events and failure effects, and to decide what should be done. Importantly, PaM can reduce total maintenance workload while the value of availability is higher and consistent. Originality/value: This paper states how to successfully implement the PaM for the solar power plant. Previously, the plant did not have a clearly defined maintenance strategy; it was checked once a year, and it was corrected when abnormalities were detected. The PaM strategy provides tools and processes for failures and effects analysis. Although there was a more workload of PM, the total maintenance workload decreased, even in the first year.","['ME', 'EE', 'IE', 'SAFETY']",enhance performance of maintenance in solar power plant emerald publishing limit purpose the purpose of this paper be to enhance the performance of maintenance in a solar power plant by implement the proactive maintenance pam strategy measure by the availability and the total maintenance workload design methodology approach the prior maintenance strategy be review and then the strategy be adjust to focus on pam failure mode and effect analysis fmea be a tool for analyze the severity and occurrence of the failure mode and effect then the why why analysis be use for investigate the root cause of failure the countermeasure be draw and the preventive maintenance pm plan be revise and carry out the total maintenance the pam and reactive maintenance workload be obtain and then the improvement be determine the value of availability be also obtain finding previously the appeared maintenance strategy be not clearly define it seem to have reactive maintenance couple with pm it be check once a year and corrective action be make when something wrong be find then the management team observe an increase in the reactive maintenance workload whereas the value of availability be not consistent and tend to drop after implement the new maintenance strategy pam the total maintenance workload decrease percent in one year the average availability of the solar power plant improve from to and the value of availability have well consistency practical implication the pam can be apply to solar power plant without limit the prior maintenance strategy and the complexity of production or machinery the solar power plant be a quite simple production and most machine consist of electrical equipment and electrical circuit the pam support to analyze the failure mode the consequence of the failure event and failure effect and to decide what should be do importantly pam can reduce total maintenance workload while the value of availability be high and consistent originality value this paper state how to successfully implement the pam for the solar power plant previously the plant do not have a clearly define maintenance strategy it be check once a year and it be correct when abnormality be detect the pam strategy provide tool and process for failure and effect analysis although there be a more workload of pm the total maintenance workload decrease even in the first year
248,Impact of Prosumers' PV reverse power flow on voltage rise in MV distribution systems,"© 2023 IEEE.This study examines the impact of reverse power flows from PV generation of the prosumers on medium voltage distribution feeders, without implementation of any curtailing strategies. Two test systems well-representing actual distribution feeders, one serving an industrial area and the other a commercial area, have been employed to analyze the impacts of voltage rise and power loss at various PV penetration levels, up to 80% on energy basis (equivalent to 234% on power basis). The simulated test results reveal that such impacts of reverse power flows from the PV prosumers can be manageable in all cases. Moreover, they contribute to reduction of power loss in respective cases. The study also compares the case of distributed PV installations (prosumers) versus the single-sited lumped PV installation (a producer). It is found that the latter causes more adverse impact on both voltage rise and power loss.",['EE'],impact of prosumer pv reverse power flow on voltage rise in mv distribution system ieee this study examine the impact of reverse power flow from pv generation of the prosumer on medium voltage distribution feeder without implementation of any curtailing strategy two test system well represent actual distribution feeder one serve an industrial area and the other a commercial area have be employ to analyze the impact of voltage rise and power loss at various pv penetration level up to on energy basis equivalent to on power basis the simulate test result reveal that such impact of reverse power flow from the pv prosumer can be manageable in all case moreover they contribute to reduction of power loss in respective case the study also compare the case of distribute pv installation prosumer versus the single site lump pv installation a producer it be find that the latter cause more adverse impact on both voltage rise and power loss
249,Weakly singular BIEM for analysis of cracks embedded in symmetric elastic whole space,"© 2018 International Association of Lowland Technology. All rights reserved.In this paper, a weakly singular boundary integral equation method is developed for the stress analysis of an anisotropic, linearly elastic, cracked whole space possessing a plane of symmetry. This study should offer an alternative powerful tool essential for the modeling of both near-surface and deeply embedded defects in a rock/soil medium. A system of governing equations is established using a pair of weakly singular, weakform, displacement and traction integral equations for the cracked whole space along with the symmetric condition. The final equations contain only unknown crack-face data in a lowerhalf of the whole space. In addition to their capability to treat cracks of arbitrary shape, material anisotropy and general loading conditions, all involved kernels are weakly singular allowing all integrals to be interpreted in the sense of Riemann. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the Galerkin approximation is implemented to solve the governing integral equations for the unknown crack-face data. To further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme, special basis functions are introduced to approximate the near-front field and the interpolation technique is adopted to evaluate all kernels for generally anisotropic materials. The solved crack-face displacement data is then utilized to postprocess for the essential fracture information along the crack front. Various scenarios are employed to verify the proposed technique and a selected set of results is presented to demonstrate its accuracy and computational robustness.","['MATH', 'MATSCI']",weakly singular biem for analysis of crack embed in symmetric elastic whole space international association of lowland technology all right reserve in this paper a weakly singular boundary integral equation method be develop for the stress analysis of an anisotropic linearly elastic crack whole space possess a plane of symmetry this study should offer an alternative powerful tool essential for the modeling of both near surface and deeply embed defect in a rock soil medium a system of governing equation be establish use a pair of weakly singular weakform displacement and traction integral equation for the cracked whole space along with the symmetric condition the final equation contain only unknown crack face datum in a lowerhalf of the whole space in addition to their capability to treat crack of arbitrary shape material anisotropy and general loading condition all involved kernel be weakly singular allow all integral to be interpret in the sense of riemann a symmetric galerkin boundary element method together with the galerkin approximation be implement to solve the govern integral equation for the unknown crack face datum to far enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the propose scheme special basis function be introduce to approximate the near front field and the interpolation technique be adopt to evaluate all kernel for generally anisotropic material the solve crack face displacement datum be then utilize to postprocess for the essential fracture information along the crack front various scenario be employ to verify the propose technique and a select set of result be present to demonstrate its accuracy and computational robustness

251,Electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate on carbon nanotube-supported silver oxide: An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdBicarbonate reduction on a silver-oxide (Ag2O)-based electrode was studied via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The effects of electrode composition, electrolyte concentration and the scan rate (10–250 mV/s) were investigated at a temperature of 27 °C. An optimum mass ratio of 70/30 (Ag2O/CNT) led to a maximum current density of 83 mA cm−2 at −0.43 V (VS Ag/AgCl). At scan rates between 10 and 250 mV/s, a negative shift with a displacement of around 1.032 V was observed – indicating the presence of irreversible reduction reactions. The observed irreversibility suggested that the reaction mechanism can be described by both diffusion and adsorption phenomena. The standard heterogeneous rate constant (ko) and the formal redox potential (Eo) were found to be 1.51 × 10−4 cm/s and 1.218 V, respectively. The EIS results confirmed the formation of the inductive loops at reduction potentials – a consequence of the adsorption of the generated species. A reduction in charge transfer resistance and a continual drop in the potential from −0.1 down to −1.4 V was also observed. This was accompanied by H2 evolution and bicarbonate production. The calculated pKa value of 10.20 upon the completion of the bicarbonate reduction reactions, confirmed the conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate ions.","['NANO', 'CHE', 'MATENG']",electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate on carbon nanotube support silver oxide an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study elsevi ltdbicarbonate reduction on a silver oxide ag o base electrode be study via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique the effect of electrode composition electrolyte concentration and the scan rate mv s be investigate at a temperature of c an optimum mass ratio of ag o cnt lead to a maximum current density of ma cm at v vs ag agcl at scan rate between and mv s a negative shift with a displacement of around v be observe indicate the presence of irreversible reduction reaction the observed irreversibility suggest that the reaction mechanism can be describe by both diffusion and adsorption phenomena the standard heterogeneous rate constant ko and the formal redox potential eo be find to be cm s and v respectively the eis result confirm the formation of the inductive loop at reduction potential a consequence of the adsorption of the generate specie a reduction in charge transfer resistance and a continual drop in the potential from down to v be also observe this be accompany by h evolution and bicarbonate production the calculate pka value of upon the completion of the bicarbonate reduction reaction confirm the conversion of bicarbonate to carbonate ion

253,Simulations of sorbent regeneration in a circulating fluidized bed system for sorption enhanced steam reforming with dolomite,"© 2019 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of SciencesIn this work, the sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) method was developed for improved hydrogen (H2) production, and the drawbacks of conventional steam reforming processes on H2 yield and purity were overcome. However, the SESR process is discontinuous and requires regeneration after sorbent saturation with CO2. The circulating fluidized bed reactor (CFBR) system has previously been proposed for continuous H2 production, with both reforming and sorbent regeneration occurring simultaneously. The main aim of this work was to determine the feasibility and performance of SESR with a proper design and conditions in conjunction with the CFBR system. The reforming riser and bubbling bed regenerator are studied separately but related to each other. Two-dimensional transient models using the Euler‒Euler approach and kinetic theory of granular flow were used for fluid dynamic simulations combined with the decarbonation kinetics of dolomite, to investigate a conceptual regenerator system and determine its key conditions. A mixture of the Ni-based catalyst and dolomite from the risers was injected with a flux of 200 kg/(m2 s) and a catalyst to sorbent ratio of 2.54 kg/kg. A double-stage bubbling bed regenerator system was designed with 1.2 m width, 0.8 m bed height, a gas inlet velocity of 0.2 m/s and solid preheating at 950 °C. The used dolomite was regenerated with an assumed CaO conversion of 3%; the almost fresh dolomite was then released with good mixing of the catalyst and sorbent.","['PE', 'ME', 'CPE', 'CHE']",simulation of sorbent regeneration in a circulate fluidize bed system for sorption enhance steam reform with dolomite chinese society of particuology and institute of process engineering chinese academy of sciencesin this work the sorption enhance steam reform sesr method be develop for improved hydrogen h production and the drawback of conventional steam reform process on h yield and purity be overcome however the sesr process be discontinuous and require regeneration after sorbent saturation with co the circulate fluidize bed reactor cfbr system have previously be propose for continuous h production with both reform and sorbent regeneration occur simultaneously the main aim of this work be to determine the feasibility and performance of sesr with a proper design and condition in conjunction with the cfbr system the reform riser and bubble bed regenerator be study separately but relate to each other two dimensional transient model use the euler euler approach and kinetic theory of granular flow be use for fluid dynamic simulation combine with the decarbonation kinetic of dolomite to investigate a conceptual regenerator system and determine its key condition a mixture of the ni base catalyst and dolomite from the riser be inject with a flux of kg m s and a catalyst to sorbent ratio of kg kg a double stage bubble bed regenerator system be design with m width m bed height a gas inlet velocity of m s and solid preheating at c the use dolomite be regenerate with an assumed cao conversion of the almost fresh dolomite be then release with good mixing of the catalyst and sorbent
254,Influence of acidity on the performance of silica supported tungsten oxide catalysts assessed by in situ and Operando DRIFTS,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The types of acidity on WOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared with different tungsten loadings (5 and 9 wt.% W) and pretreatment atmospheres (N2 and H2) were clarified by using the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy with temperature-programmed desorption (in situ DRIFTS-TPD) technique. Ammonia (NH3) acted as probe molecules that could block Lewis acid site type II (1620 cm−1) on the studied catalysts. The reactant feed containing 2% trans-2-butene or mixed feed of 2% trans-2-butene and 4% ethylene were used to investigate the reaction pathway on the WOx/SiO2 catalysts. Combining the Operando DRIFTS with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (Operando DRIFTS-GC-FID) technique and in situ DRIFTS-TPD led to more deeply understanding of the correlation of acid sites and the primary cross metathesis reaction as the main reaction with isomerization of trans-2-butene as the side reaction. The adsorption energy of pulse chemisorption of 1-butene on catalyst by in situ DSC, confirmed the presence of the Lewis acid site type II related to the opportunity of 1-butene adsorption. The results confirmed that the Lewis acid site at 1620 cm−1 was crucial for the secondary metathesis reaction of 1-butene.","['PE', 'METAL', 'CHE']",influence of acidity on the performance of silica support tungsten oxide catalyst assess by in situ and operando drift elsevi b v the type of acidity on wox sio catalyst prepared with different tungsten loading and wt w and pretreatment atmosphere n and h be clarify by use the in situ diffuse reflectance infrare fourier transform spectroscopy with temperature program desorption in situ drift tpd technique ammonia nh act as probe molecule that could block lewis acid site type ii cm on the studied catalyst the reactant feed contain trans butene or mixed feed of trans butene and ethylene be use to investigate the reaction pathway on the wox sio catalyst combine the operando drift with gas chromatography flame ionization detector operando drift gc fid technique and in situ drift tpd lead to more deeply understanding of the correlation of acid site and the primary cross metathesis reaction as the main reaction with isomerization of trans butene as the side reaction the adsorption energy of pulse chemisorption of butene on catalyst by in situ dsc confirm the presence of the lewis acid site type ii relate to the opportunity of butene adsorption the result confirm that the lewis acid site at cm be crucial for the secondary metathesis reaction of butene

The Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory is adopted to take into account the surface energy effects. The contact surface between the plate and the half-space is assumed to be smooth, and the deflected shape of the plate is represented by a power series of the radial coordinate. The undetermined coefficients in the series are determined through the minimization of the total potential energy functional of the plate-half-space system. The accuracy of the present solution is verified by comparing with existing solutions, and selected numerical results are presented to portray the influence of surface energy effects on interaction between an elastic circular plate and an elastic half-space.","['CE', 'MATH']",variational formulation of interaction between elastic plate and elastic medium under the influence of surface energy the author publish by edp science a variational formulation of interaction problem be present in this paper for the analysis of an elastic circular plate under axisymmetric vertical loading rest on an isotropic elastic half space under the influence of surface energy the gurtin murdoch surface elasticity theory be adopt to take into account the surface energy effect the contact surface between the plate and the half space be assume to be smooth and the deflected shape of the plate be represent by a power series of the radial coordinate the undetermined coefficient in the series be determine through the minimization of the total potential energy functional of the plate half space system the accuracy of the present solution be verify by compare with exist solution and select numerical result be present to portray the influence of surface energy effect on interaction between an elastic circular plate and an elastic half space

257,Production of reducing sugar from cassava starch waste (CSW) using solution plasma process (SPP),"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe cassava starch processing plays an important role in food industries. During starch processing stage, a large amount of cassava starch waste (CSW) which mainly contains lost starch product and solid residue such as cassava bagasse are produced. Starch and cassava bagasse can be hydrolyzed into fermentable sugar such as glucose. In the present study, the solution plasma process (SPP) is used to treat CSW to prepare reducing sugar. The investigated parameters are treatment time, solvent concentration, applied pulsed frequency, and CSW concentration. The %yield of total reducing sugar (TRS) and glucose were calculated by DNS method and glucose assay kit, respectively. The chemical structure, morphology, and crystal structure of plasma-treated CSW were investigated. The results showed that the %yield of TRS was greatly enhanced by SPP treatment compared to that of acid hydrolysis. The CSW powder completely broke down into pieces after SPP treatment was applied. The amorphous and crystalline regions of CSW were destroyed during SPP treatment.

259,Detecting points of interest in a city from taxi GPS with adaptive DBSCAN,"© 2018 IEEE.Points of Interest (POIs) are popular places that create activities and transportation demands in a city. As cities constantly evolve, keeping an up-To-date map of POIs is difficult. However, by observing digital footprints of people, including taxi pick-up and drop-off locations, we can detect hotspots of activities that indicate POI locations by using techniques such as point clustering. DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm for geographic data points. However, the effectiveness of the algorithm relies on determining appropriate parameters that match the distribution pattern of data points. That is hard because pick-up and drop-off locations are distributed differently in different areas. This paper proposes a method to automatically determine the parameters of DBSCAN according to point distribution in each dataset. The algorithm has been applied to pick-up and drop-off locations of taxis in Bangkok.

261,An SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network,"© 2018 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).Video conference is the most popular application which is required high quality of service (QoS) such as delay and jitter. Several existing mechanisms for enhancing were proposed in the traditional network not only at the application side as video clients but also at the network core as network routers. Although, these mechanisms can provide a good quality of service, they require a lot of maintenance cost. In addition, the static routing with the shortest-path fashion at the network gateways is not enough to provide a high quality of service for video/audio data transferring due to the affectation of background traffic. Software Defined Network (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that allows a network operator to manage their network environment by programmable centralized control. This not only reduces the cost of maintenance but also increase the performance of networking. In this paper, we proposed an SDN framework for video conference in inter-domain network. The framework used the Packet Pair technique to consider the characteristics of bandwidth and end-to-end delay between two video conference clients. A transferring path and network gateway inside-domain are set up based on this information without a requirement of a routing modification of outside-domains.

The parametric uncertainty appears in the dynamic matrix and input matrix and satisfies n orm-bounded c ondition. F irst, w e d erive i nner closed-loop model and use this model to design RMPC. The design of RMPC involves a min-max optimization problem which aims to find the optimal solution minimizing the worst case performance.

263,Characterization of N-type and P-type Aluminum Antimonides on Si substrates for room-temperature optoelectronic devices,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdTo develop Aluminum Antimonide (AlSb) -based optoelectronic devices on Si substrates, AlSb films were investigated for a good crystalline quality and suitable optical and electrical properties. Under an optimized growth condition by RF-magnetron sputtering technique, the AlSb films were grown at a sputtering power of 250 W and a pressure of 0.01 mbar in argon atmosphere and a precursor Al:Sb ratio of about 88:12. The undoped AlSb films were found to have a cubic crystal structure with (111) preferred orientation and a lattice constant of 5.9985 Å under compressive strain. For the doped AlSb samples with optimized doping contents, the AlSb:Si and AlSb:Cu films with higher compressive strain were found to have a smaller lattice constant of 5.9588 Å and 5.9667 Å respectively. Raman spectroscopy indicated strain states and lower crystalline quality induced by doping. The optical properties, analyzed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry, showed that the undoped AlSb film was transparent to IR at around 850 nm, where the doped films were transparent to IR at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the electrical properties of the AlSb films, n-type AlSb:Cu and p-type AlSb:Si films were characterized by Hall-Effect measurements. To develop AlSb-based optoelectronic devices, a PIN diode structure was grown on Si substrate. The smooth interfaces between the AlSb layers and with Si substrate were confirmed by cross-sectional TEM micrographs. Finally, I-V measurements showed diode characteristics with a turn-on voltage of about + 1.5 V for forward bias and −0.5 V for reverse bias. In summary, the AlSb-based diode structure on Si substrate had been successfully fabricated by optimized sputtering deposition. This is promising for future development of the AlSb-based optoelectronic devices.","['METAL', 'EE', 'OPTIC', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",characterization of n type and p type aluminum antimonide on si substrate for room temperature optoelectronic device elsevi ltdto develop aluminum antimonide alsb base optoelectronic device on si substrate alsb film be investigate for a good crystalline quality and suitable optical and electrical property under an optimize growth condition by rf magnetron sputtering technique the alsb film be grow at a sputtering power of w and a pressure of mbar in argon atmosphere and a precursor al sb ratio of about the undoped alsb film be find to have a cubic crystal structure with preferred orientation and a lattice constant of å under compressive strain for the dope alsb sample with optimize dope content the alsb si and alsb cu film with high compressive strain be find to have a small lattice constant of å and å respectively raman spectroscopy indicate strain state and low crystalline quality induce by dope the optical property analyze by uv vis spectrophotometry show that the undoped alsb film be transparent to ir at around nm where the dope film be transparent to ir at long wavelength to evaluate the electrical property of the alsb film n type alsb cu and p type alsb si film be characterize by hall effect measurement to develop alsb base optoelectronic device a pin diode structure be grow on si substrate the smooth interface between the alsb layer and with si substrate be confirm by cross sectional tem micrograph finally I v measurement show diode characteristic with a turn on voltage of about v for forward bias and v for reverse bias in summary the alsb base diode structure on si substrate have be successfully fabricate by optimize sputter deposition this be promise for future development of the alsb base optoelectronic device
264,"Synthesis, thermal properties and curing kinetics of hyperbranched BPA/PEG Epoxy resin","© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The hyperbranched epoxy resins (HBE) composed of bisphenol A (BPA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as reactants and pentaerythritol as branching point were successfully synthesized via A2 + B4 polycondensation reaction at various BPA/PEG ratios. The 13C NMR spectra revealed that the synthesized HBE mainly had a dendritic structure as confirmed by the high degree of branching (DB). The addition of PEG in the resin enhanced degree of branching (DB) (from 0.82 to 0.90), epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) (from 697 g eq-1 to 468 g eq-1) as well as curing reaction. Adding 5-10 wt.% PEG in the resin decreased the onset and peak curing temperatures and glass transition temperature; however, adding 15 wt.% PEG in the resin have increased these thermal properties due to the lowest EEW. The curing kinetics were evaluated by fitting the experimental data of the curing behavior of all resins with the Šesták-Berggren equation. The activation energy increased with the increase of PEG in the resins due to HBE's steric hindrance, whereas the activation energy of HBE15P decreased due to a large amount of equivalent active epoxy group per mass sample. The curing behavior and thermal properties of obtained hyperbranched BPA/PEG epoxy resin would be suitable for using in electronics application.","['ME', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",synthesis thermal property and cure kinetic of hyperbranche bpa peg epoxy resin by the author licensee mdpi basel switzerland the hyperbranche epoxy resin hbe compose of bisphenol a bpa and polyethylene glycol peg as reactant and pentaerythritol as branching point be successfully synthesize via a b polycondensation reaction at various bpa peg ratio the c nmr spectra reveal that the synthesized hbe mainly have a dendritic structure as confirm by the high degree of branch db the addition of peg in the resin enhance degree of branch db from to epoxy equivalent weight eew from g eq to g eq as well as cure reaction add wt peg in the resin decrease the onset and peak cure temperature and glass transition temperature however add wt peg in the resin have increase these thermal property due to the low eew the cure kinetic be evaluate by fit the experimental datum of the cure behavior of all resin with the šesták berggren equation the activation energy increase with the increase of peg in the resin due to hbe s steric hindrance whereas the activation energy of hbe p decrease due to a large amount of equivalent active epoxy group per mass sample the cure behavior and thermal property of obtain hyperbranche bpa peg epoxy resin would be suitable for use in electronics application
265,Computation of three-finger grasping plane,"© 2018 IEEE.Empowering a robot with ability to grasp has been a long dream in robotics. Despite serious research effort over many decades, even the most advanced robots still struggle in the area of grasping. The main challenge is how to deal with errors and uncertainty. In grasp planning, traditional methods such as ICR and caging deal with the uncertainty problem at the contact level and suffer the poor performances. This paper explores a more global outlook by aiming at finding a promising grasping plane (instead of individual points) to place the three contact points. The paper presents a heuristic method to find a plane through the object to place the three finger contact. The input of the method is the input mesh model of the object.

266,Enhancement of strengths of high-calcium fly ash geopolymer containing borax with rice husk ash,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe objective of this study was to investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of a high-calcium fly ash geopolymer prepared with borax modified by the addition of rice husk ash (RHA). The sodium silicate was replaced with borax, on an equal mass basis, at 0, 10, 20, and 30%. The results showed that the use of borax instead of sodium silicate reduced both the compressive and flexural strengths. The strength decreases when borax was used were related to the increase in the crystalline nature of the reaction products caused by the decreases in the Si/Al ratios of the gel phases formed. Moreover, incorporating 3.6–6.0% RHA into geopolymer mortars containing either hydrated borax or anhydrous borax led to an improvement in the compressive strength due to the formation of a Ca-modified N-A-S-H gel with a high Si/Al ratio during the reaction.","['CE', 'PE', 'METAL', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",enhancement of strength of high calcium fly ash geopolymer contain borax with rice husk ash elsevi ltdthe objective of this study be to investigate the microstructure and mechanical property of a high calcium fly ash geopolymer prepare with borax modify by the addition of rice husk ash rha the sodium silicate be replace with borax on an equal mass basis at and the result show that the use of borax instead of sodium silicate reduce both the compressive and flexural strength the strength decrease when borax be use be relate to the increase in the crystalline nature of the reaction product cause by the decrease in the si al ratio of the gel phase form moreover incorporate rha into geopolymer mortar contain either hydrated borax or anhydrous borax lead to an improvement in the compressive strength due to the formation of a ca modify n a s h gel with a high si al ratio during the reaction
267,An adaptive large neighborhood search for the multiple-day music rehearsal problems,"© 2021 The Author(s)This paper presents an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) framework to solve the Multiple-Day Music Rehearsal Problem (MMRP), where music pieces with different player sets and durations are arranged in a predefined number of rehearsal days so that the total days of attendance and waiting times experienced by all players are minimized. Two variants of the MMRP, namely the MMRP without setup times (MMRP-0) and the MMRP with setup times (MMRP-1), are herein explored based on mathematical formulations of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Music Rehearsal Problem (MRP). Extensive computational results on 120 generated instances and 78 benchmark instances indicate that the ALNS is greatly efficient as it can provide equivalent or better solutions than the exact method and a benchmark heuristic from the literature, with much less computational time. We also find that the ALNS tends to perform better in large and complicated MMRP settings, considering that it outperforms the time-restricted CPLEX in 34 out of 120 generated instances and successfully finds 4 new best-known solutions to 8 large benchmark instances.","['IE', 'MATH']",an adaptive large neighborhood search for the multiple day music rehearsal problem the author s this paper present an adaptive large neighborhood search alns framework to solve the multiple day music rehearsal problem mmrp where music piece with different player set and duration be arrange in a predefine number of rehearsal day so that the total day of attendance and waiting time experience by all player be minimize two variant of the mmrp namely the mmrp without setup times mmrp and the mmrp with setup times mmrp be herein explore base on mathematical formulation of the capacitate vehicle routing problem cvrp and the music rehearsal problem mrp extensive computational result on generate instance and benchmark instance indicate that the alns be greatly efficient as it can provide equivalent or well solution than the exact method and a benchmark heuristic from the literature with much less computational time we also find that the alns tend to perform well in large and complicated mmrp setting consider that it outperform the time restrict cplex in out of generate instance and successfully find new well know solution to large benchmark instance
268,Performance of CaO catalyst prepared from magnetic-derived CaCO3 for biodiesel production,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThis paper studied the different CaCO3 crystal forms between calcite and aragonite under magnetic fields using calcocarbonic solution prepared from dissolving ground natural shell. The experiments were conducted by exposing the solution to magnetic fields. The characteristics of reprecipitated CaCO3 were investigated. The aragonite/calcite ratios were proportional to magnetic flux densities. The physicochemical properties of CaO catalysts from thermal decomposition of CaCO3 depended on polymorphic ratios. The performances of the catalysts for biodiesel reaction were studied. The transesterifications of palm oil and methanol were comparatively performed using CaO catalysts prepared from different CaCO3 polymorphs. The transesterification reacted by CaO prepared from all polymorphic ratios yielded more than 85% of biodiesel under optimal conditions. Some amount of calcium was leached into the reaction medium depending on different polymorphic ratios of precursors. However, the leached calcium did not enhance the biodiesel yield. In addition, CaO-600 mT catalyst is the most promising considering that it is a residual catalyst from shell waste.

271,Physics-based motion capture imitation with deep reinforcement learning,"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.We introduce a deep reinforcement learning method that learns to control articulated humanoid bodies to imitate given target motions closely when simulated in a physics simulator. The target motion, which may not have been seen by the agent and can be noisy, is supplied at runtime. Our method can recover balance from moderate external disturbances and keep imitating the target motion. When subjected to large disturbances that cause the humanoid to fall down, our method can control the character to get up and recover to track the motion. Our method is trained to imitate the mocap clips from the CMU motion capture database and a number of other publicly available databases. We use a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to dynamically control the gain of PD controllers, whose target angles are derived from the mocap clip and to apply corrective torques with the goal of imitating the provided motion clip as closely as possible. Both the simulation and the learning algorithms are parallelized and run on the GPU.

272,Effects of Formation Brine Compositions on Effectiveness of Low Salinity Brine Injection in Carbonate Reservoir,"© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Nowadays, Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSWF) is considered as one of the most effective techniques to enhance oil recovery. Essential mechanism is a Multi-Ion Exchange (MIE). In carbonate formation, collaboration of Potential Determining Ions (PDI) with rock surface and crude oil results in adjustment of surface equilibrium. These ions in injected brine are thoroughly investigated but effects from formation brine are not well documented. In this study, ratio of divalent ions including calcium and magnesium ions in formation brine is studied. Results from imbibition test shows that formation brine containing calcium ion to magnesium ion ratio of 1:1 yields response to LSWF. Oppositely, formation brines with high ratios of 10:1 and 15:1 do not respond to LSWF. As calcium ion in connate water diffuses to injected water, high calcium ion will exhibit dissolution mechanism of rock surface which is part of oil recovery mechanisms. Formation brine with high calcium ion is therefore not recommended for LSWF. High portion of magnesium ion in formation brine does not affect effectiveness of LSWF. Dissolution of magnesium from rock may be obstructed but oil can still be liberated from calcium carboxylate complex and dissolution of calcium. Coreflood test shows similar result which confirms previous explanation.","['ENV', 'PE', 'METAL', 'CHE']",effect of formation brine composition on effectiveness of low salinity brine injection in carbonate reservoir the author publish by edp sciences nowadays low salinity waterflooding lswf be consider as one of the most effective technique to enhance oil recovery essential mechanism be a multi ion exchange mie in carbonate formation collaboration of potential determine ion pdi with rock surface and crude oil result in adjustment of surface equilibrium these ion in inject brine be thoroughly investigate but effect from formation brine be not well document in this study ratio of divalent ion include calcium and magnesium ion in formation brine be study result from imbibition test show that formation brine contain calcium ion to magnesium ion ratio of yield response to lswf oppositely formation brine with high ratio of and do not respond to lswf as calcium ion in connate water diffuse to inject water high calcium ion will exhibit dissolution mechanism of rock surface which be part of oil recovery mechanism formation brine with high calcium ion be therefore not recommend for lswf high portion of magnesium ion in formation brine do not affect effectiveness of lswf dissolution of magnesium from rock may be obstruct but oil can still be liberate from calcium carboxylate complex and dissolution of calcium coreflood test show similar result which confirm previous explanation

All rights reserved.In this work, the hybrid films were fabricated by utilized the polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix embedded by microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) extracted from bagasse by 10% (w/v) sodium hydroxide (NaOH). To enhance the dielectric property of the hybrid films, the polarity of MCC was then modified by surface coating with 1% by mole of silver. The physical and chemical properties of MCC and nanosilver coated microcrystalline cellulose (Ag-MCC) were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and TGA. PLA with various ratios of MCC or Ag-MCC (1-5phr) were prepared as hybrid films by solution casting method. The dielectric properties of PLA, PLA/MCC and PLA/Ag-MCC hybrid films were measured at different frequencies ranging from 1kHz - 1MHz.

The definition of the formal model should be understandable and clear in order to express the structure and behaviors of the system visually using diagrammatic tools. In this paper, we focused on the formal model which is written in Promela language that supports the non-determinism of the concurrent system.

Ten patient-specific VMAT QA were randomly selected to test their error detection sensitivities. Artificial complex errors were introduced to the original plans then the QA tests were repeated. These errors were simulated into three possible scenarios: Uncertainty, miss-calibration, and worst-case scenario. For uncertainty scenario, the random errors (σ) of multi-leaf collimators (MLC) at ± 2.0 mm and gantry angle at ± 2.0 degree were introduced. The systematic errors of +2MU, and the random errors of MLC and gantry angle at ± 2.0 mm and ± 2.0 degree were applied as a miss-calibration scenario. For worst case scenario, errors were integrated between systematic and random variation of MLC and gantry angle at 2±0.5 mm and 2±0.5 degree, respectively. The dosimetric agreements between QA tests on original versus artificial error plans were determined to investigate error detection sensitivity used gamma analysis with 3%, 3 mm criteria.

279,Corrosion of amorphous alumina in deionized water under mild condition,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Alumina is known for its inertness and chemical resistance. Unless the condition is near the critical point, it is conventional to assume that the reaction between alumina and water does not take place within short period of time. This assumption also includes amorphous alumina, which is formed via sputtering to protect microelectronic components. This work shows that amorphous alumina film indeed reacts with deionized (DI) water within minutes even in mild conditions.

280,Mixture of MEA/2-MAE for effective CO2 capture from flue gas stream,"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.The climate change and global warming are the main environmental concerns because of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. The main sources of CO2 is from power plants in the form of flue gas. Recently, the effective technology to capture CO2 is chemical absorption by using aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solution is monoethanolamine (MEA). It has disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. 2-methylaminoethanol (2-MAE) as a new solvent has been formulated to improve the performance of CO2 mitigation but the cost of this chemical is higher. The two amines are mixed together to obtain higher performance and to compensate the drawbacks of each solvents. The objective of this research is to measure the solubility of CO2 in a mixed solvent with 20: 10 wt% of MEA and 2-MAE for CO2 capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of 313.15 K and 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The experimental results are compared with that of single solution of MEA and 2-MAE at the same conditions. From the results, it is reported that in term of cyclic capacity, the amine mixture provides a better performance, which is higher than that of MEA ranging from 2.35 % to 61.90 % but lower than that of 2-MAE from 8.76 % to 43.45 %. The rate of CO2 loading of mixed solution is relatively close to that of MEA but lower than that of 2-MAE. Therefore, in the future, the mixed solvent may be used as an alternative solution for CO2 capture instead of using single amine.","['ENV', 'PE', 'CHE']",mixture of mea mae for effective co capture from flue gas stream copyright aidic servizi s r l the climate change and global warming be the main environmental concern because of co emission into the atmosphere the main source of co be from power plant in the form of flue gas recently the effective technology to capture co be chemical absorption by use aqueous amine solution the commonly use amine solution be monoethanolamine mea it have disadvantage like low capacity and high energy consumption methylaminoethanol mae as a new solvent have be formulate to improve the performance of co mitigation but the cost of this chemical be high the two amine be mix together to obtain high performance and to compensate the drawback of each solvent the objective of this research be to measure the solubility of co in a mixed solvent with wt of mea and mae for co capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of k and k and co partial pressure range from to kpa the experimental result be compare with that of single solution of mea and mae at the same condition from the result it be report that in term of cyclic capacity the amine mixture provide a well performance which be high than that of mea range from to but low than that of mae from to the rate of co loading of mixed solution be relatively close to that of mea but low than that of mae therefore in the future the mixed solvent may be use as an alternative solution for co capture instead of use single amine
281,Elimination of Zinc Dendrites by Graphene Oxide Electrolyte Additive for Zinc-Ion Batteries,"© Zinc-ion batteries have drawn tremendous attention in the electrochemical energy storage market because of their merits of high safety and low cost, however, the dendrites issue of zinc anodes remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a hybrid electrolyte with graphene oxide as an additive with the functions of promoting the uniform distribution of the electric field and reducing the nucleation overpotential of Zn2+, displaying a smooth zinc electrodeposition layer and reaction kinetics. The resultant zinc symmetric battery with graphene oxide additive affords a stable zinc anode which provided service for more than 650 h at 1 mA cm-2 and an exceptional cycle life of 140 h even at 10 mA cm-2. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the deposition of zinc dendrites through the glass fiber separator was the reason for the battery short circuit. It is believed that the graphene oxide additive can remarkably improve the Coulombic efficiency (99.16%) of the batteries via stabilizing the Zn plating/stripping behavior and facilitating Zn2+ nucleation. Consequently, the full battery with graphene oxide electrolyte additive exhibited remarkable enhancements in rate performance and cyclability compared to the additive-free electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte containing solid particles opens a chapter for designing advanced and durable zinc-ion batteries.","['PE', 'METAL', 'EE', 'NANO', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",elimination of zinc dendrite by graphene oxide electrolyte additive for zinc ion battery zinc ion battery have draw tremendous attention in the electrochemical energy storage market because of their merit of high safety and low cost however the dendrite issue of zinc anode remain a challenge herein we develop a hybrid electrolyte with graphene oxide as an additive with the function of promote the uniform distribution of the electric field and reduce the nucleation overpotential of zn display a smooth zinc electrodeposition layer and reaction kinetic the resultant zinc symmetric battery with graphene oxide additive afford a stable zinc anode which provide service for more than h at ma cm and an exceptional cycle life of h even at ma cm in addition scan electron microscopy image demonstrate that the deposition of zinc dendrite through the glass fiber separator be the reason for the battery short circuit it be believe that the graphene oxide additive can remarkably improve the coulombic efficiency of the battery via stabilize the zn plate strip behavior and facilitate zn nucleation consequently the full battery with graphene oxide electrolyte additive exhibit remarkable enhancement in rate performance and cyclability compare to the additive free electrolyte the hybrid electrolyte contain solid particle open a chapter for design advanced and durable zinc ion battery
282,Analysis for T-stress of cracks in 3D anisotropic elastic media by weakly singular integral equation method,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.This paper proposes an efficient numerical procedure for computing T-stresses of cracks in three-dimensional, linearly elastic, infinite media. The technique is established in a broad framework allowing a medium made of generally anisotropic materials and cracks of arbitrary shape and under general loading conditions to be treated. A pair of weakly singular, weak-form, displacement and traction boundary integral equations is utilized to formulate the key equations governing the unknown crack-face fields. Besides the basic benefits such as the reduction of spatial dimensions of the solution space and the efficient treatment of unbounded domains and remote boundary data, use of such integral equations in the formulation offers additional positive features including the computational simplicity resulting from the weakly singular nature of all involved integrals and the involvement of a complete set of crack-face displacement fields. A weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the special near-front approximation is utilized to solve for the unknown relative crack-face displacement whereas the sum of the crack-face displacement is obtained from the displacement boundary integral equation for cracks via the Galerkin technique. The latter step is one of the essential aspects of the present study that provides the direct means for determining the T-stress data in terms of the sum of the crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack-front. An extensive numerical study is conducted for various scenarios and a selected set of results is reported to demonstrate both the accuracy and capability of the proposed technique.","['OPTIC', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",analysis for t stress of crack in d anisotropic elastic medium by weakly singular integral equation method elsevi b v this paper propose an efficient numerical procedure for compute t stress of crack in three dimensional linearly elastic infinite medium the technique be establish in a broad framework allow a medium make of generally anisotropic material and crack of arbitrary shape and under general loading condition to be treat a pair of weakly singular weak form displacement and traction boundary integral equation be utilize to formulate the key equation govern the unknown crack face field besides the basic benefit such as the reduction of spatial dimension of the solution space and the efficient treatment of unbounded domain and remote boundary datum use of such integral equation in the formulation offer additional positive feature include the computational simplicity result from the weakly singular nature of all involved integral and the involvement of a complete set of crack face displacement field a weakly singular symmetric galerkin boundary element method together with the special near front approximation be utilize to solve for the unknown relative crack face displacement whereas the sum of the crack face displacement be obtain from the displacement boundary integral equation for crack via the galerkin technique the latter step be one of the essential aspect of the present study that provide the direct mean for determine the t stress datum in term of the sum of the crack face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack front an extensive numerical study be conduct for various scenario and a select set of result be report to demonstrate both the accuracy and capability of the propose technique

285,Investigation of wax deposition prevention by using n-heptane for sustainable energy production from Fang oilfield,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Waxy crude oils are normally found in petroleum reservoirs. Crude oil from wax formation is one of the crucial problems for flow assurance of pipeline transportation in oil and gas production. This issue can commonly cause wax deposition problem and it has made huge amount of economic loses such as production, time and maintenance cost. Therefore, it is a critical aspect to deal with wax deposition for crude oil flow assurance, especially in cold climate surface region. Nowadays, there are many methods that have been applied to reduce the wax deposition. In general, three methods are commonly utilized, mechanical, thermal and chemical ones. Among them, the usage of chemicals is commonly used in field because they can be applied easily rather than other techniques. In this study, n-heptane is select to study the prevention the wax deposition because its property can reduce the pour point and wax deposit of crude oil. It is easily available as well. Therefore, the aim of this research is investigate the effects of temperature and different chemical concentration on pour point and wax deposition of crude oil at three different temperature ranging from 35 to 55 °C by applying cold finger method. Also, the pour point of crude oil is measured with different n-heptane concentrations by ASTM method. Moreover, the effect of different chemical concentrations on wax appearance temperature (WAT) is examined the temperature between from 80 °C to 40 °C with three different shear rates by viscometry method. From the results, it is reported that the total wax deposits from the cold finger depend on the amount of chemical concentration used. WAT with 20% n-heptane provides the highest performance for WAT reduction with 41 °C. Compared to 5%, 10% and 15% n-heptane concentration, WATs are reduced to 45 °C, 44 °C and 43 °C, respectively. For the pour point results, the higher amount of n-heptane concentration offers the higher reduction in pour point temperature and pour points are reduced significantly from original pour point at 36 °C to 34 °C, 30 °C, 26 °C and 22 °C with 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% n-heptane, respectively. It is also found that the amount of total wax deposits decrease when chemical concentrations increase. Moreover, the decline of temperature is found as one of the main factors to cause more wax deposition. There is a highest wax deposit reduction rate with 20% n-heptane at different temperatures compared to other concentration. The wax deposition is reduced over 50% for each concentration. Therefore, this result is useful for the application of wax deposition, pour point and WAT studies in the crude oil production with less damaging environment for sustainable energy production.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'CHE']",investigation of wax deposition prevention by use n heptane for sustainable energy production from fang oilfield publish under licence by iop publish ltd waxy crude oil be normally find in petroleum reservoir crude oil from wax formation be one of the crucial problem for flow assurance of pipeline transportation in oil and gas production this issue can commonly cause wax deposition problem and it have make huge amount of economic lose such as production time and maintenance cost therefore it be a critical aspect to deal with wax deposition for crude oil flow assurance especially in cold climate surface region nowadays there be many method that have be apply to reduce the wax deposition in general three method be commonly utilize mechanical thermal and chemical one among they the usage of chemical be commonly use in field because they can be apply easily rather than other technique in this study n heptane be select to study the prevention the wax deposition because its property can reduce the pour point and wax deposit of crude oil it be easily available as well therefore the aim of this research be investigate the effect of temperature and different chemical concentration on pour point and wax deposition of crude oil at three different temperature range from to c by apply cold finger method also the pour point of crude oil be measure with different n heptane concentration by astm method moreover the effect of different chemical concentration on wax appearance temperature wat be examine the temperature between from c to c with three different shear rate by viscometry method from the result it be report that the total wax deposit from the cold finger depend on the amount of chemical concentration use wat with n heptane provide the high performance for wat reduction with c compare to and n heptane concentration wat be reduce to c c and c respectively for the pour point result the high amount of n heptane concentration offer the high reduction in pour point temperature and pour point be reduce significantly from original pour point at c to c c c and c with and n heptane respectively it be also find that the amount of total wax deposit decrease when chemical concentration increase moreover the decline of temperature be find as one of the main factor to cause more wax deposition there be a high wax deposit reduction rate with n heptane at different temperature compare to other concentration the wax deposition be reduce over for each concentration therefore this result be useful for the application of wax deposition pour point and wat study in the crude oil production with less damaging environment for sustainable energy production

In particular, the robot is used in various types of tasks in the food industry, for example, the partition of chicken breast. Applying robots is the solution to optimizing the production process because the traditional method, which is operated by human labor, is prone to error. The objective of this paper is to design and develop the robotic application to control the IAI Robot and depth camera for slicing a solid, which represents a chicken breast, into equal-mass slices perpendicular to the x-axis. The robotic application consists of four procedures: the settings of the operating system, the point cloud capture and transformation, the solid slicing algorithm, and the robot operation. Furthermore, we designed an experiment to estimate the error of each slice that is sliced using this developed robotic application. In terms of conclusion, the developed robotic application can be applied according to the objective of this paper, where the average percentage of error of a slice that is sliced from 100 grams of solid into two, three, and four equal-mass slices is approximately 0.77%, 2.64%, and 3.67%, respectively.","['ME', 'CPE', 'OPTIC']",design of the robot application for slice food into equal mass slice ieee robot will become far more integral to human daily life in the future in particular the robot be use in various type of task in the food industry for example the partition of chicken breast apply robot be the solution to optimize the production process because the traditional method which be operate by human labor be prone to error the objective of this paper be to design and develop the robotic application to control the iai robot and depth camera for slice a solid which represent a chicken breast into equal mass slice perpendicular to the x axis the robotic application consist of four procedure the setting of the operating system the point cloud capture and transformation the solid slicing algorithm and the robot operation furthermore we design an experiment to estimate the error of each slice that be slice use this develop robotic application in term of conclusion the develop robotic application can be apply accord to the objective of this paper where the average percentage of error of a slice that be slice from gram of solid into two three and four equal mass slice be approximately and respectively

289,Sequential elastic recovery stress edge-smoothed finite element method for lower-bound limit determination of structures,"© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.The paper proposes an efficient sequential edge-smoothed finite element (ES-FE) analysis method enhanced with the smoothed recovery stress field to determine the collapse load limit of inelastic structures. The approach applies a modified concept of elastic compensation algorithm developed within the computationally advantageous ES-FE modelling framework and recovery stress field enhancement. It solely performs a series of standard elastic analyses to successively converge the limit load of structures at plastic collapse. Each analysis systematically adjusts the values of elastic moduli associated with some critical elements as determined by the intensity of stress resultants and hence considers inelastic stress distributions. The computing efforts are as modest as would be required to furnish standard linear elastic analysis procedures. What is important is that the proposed modulus smoothing technique enables the fast assembly of modified stiffness formulations, and the recovery stress field ensures the smoothed C0-continuous admissible stress conditions enhancing the satisfaction of yield conformity over an entire element. Various successfully solved numerical examples highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis framework in overcoming the numerical challenges associated with stress singularity and volumetric locking phenomena under incompressibility conditions.

The building model has two rooms equipped with air-conditioning (AC) system where they contain heat interactions with walking path and the outdoor. Only one-dimensional heat transfer and internal energy change have been concerned while neglecting the effects caused by humidity and air leakage. Cooling energy from the AC system is expressed via the coefficient of performance (COP) and is a nonlinear function of room temperatures. We propose an approximate linear model with an assumption that the COP is a constant obtained by the air-conditioner specifications or it can be estimated.

The Mg-Al mixed oxide was then derived by calcination of hydrotalcite at 450℃. The metal modified catalysts (Mo/Mg-Al and V/Mg-Al) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The obtained catalysts were characterized by several useful techniques and tested the reactivity for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol (gas-phase) to produce acetaldehyde. The catalytic reactions were performed at temperature range from 200 to 400℃ for both non-oxidative and oxidative atmospheres. The results showed that the vanadium-modified hydrotalcite (V/Mg-Al) exhibited the highest ethanol conversion (34.3%) and acetaldehyde yield (15.5%) at 400℃ in the non-oxidative atmosphere. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol, the V/Mg-Al catalyst showed the highest activity at 400℃ giving the ethanol conversion and acetaldehyde yield of 73.7% and 29.5%, respectively. This result probably related to the highest base density of V/Mg-Al catalyst (6.13 µmol CO2/m2) measured by CO2-TPD.

294,Design of state-feedback control for polynomial systems with quadratic performance criterion and control input constraints,"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.This paper presents a novel convex optimization approach to design state-feedback control for polynomial systems. Design criteria are comprised of a quadratic cost function and bounded magnitudes of control inputs. Specifically, we formulate a control synthesis of closed-loop systems operated in a given bounded domain characterized by a semi-algebraic set. We consider an extended class of rational Lyapunov functions and derive an upper bound of the cost function, together with a state-feedback control law. By exploiting bounds on the control input magnitudes, the controller design condition can be cast as a parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (PDLMI), which is convex optimization and can be efficiently solved by sum-of-squares (SOS) technique.

295,Application of biochar coupled with FGD waste for waste management in agriculture improvement,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Flue gas desulfurization waste (FGD) is one of coal combustion products (CCP) in coal-fired power plants. Mostly, FGD gypsum is applied in cement and wallboard industry. Also, it can be used in agricultural activities for soil amendment but the amount of FGD waste used in this function is still low. Furthermore, biochar has long been used to improve soil fertility. The positive impacts of biochar amendment on soils are that it can increase soil capacity to adsorb plant nutrients, decrease soil bulk density, increase plant available water retention and so on. In Thailand, some areas like Nan province has a problem of soil degradation from deforestation and excess use of chemical fertilizer. With the benefits of these FGD waste and biochar, the study of soil amendment will be performed by using degraded soil. Therefore, this research is aimed to apply FGD waste coupled with biochar to improve soil quality from degraded soil in Nan Province. Also, the objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of FGD waste and biochar on soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density and soil texture. The concentrations of FGD waste and biochar are ranged from 5-25% and 5-30% by weight, respectively. The results present that the soil quality has been improved in that pH can increases from 5.664 up to 7.309. The soil texture has changed in the better quality from clay to silty loam or loam. Furthermore, the bulk density of soil is reduced in order to have more space for air and water for all mixture which is conducive to plant growth. Consequently, this research can contribute to the improvement of degraded soil properties to fit well for agriculture and the results can be applied for practice in the real field.","['CE', 'ENV', 'PE', 'CHE']",application of biochar couple with fgd waste for waste management in agriculture improvement publish under licence by iop publish ltd flue gas desulfurization waste fgd be one of coal combustion product ccp in coal fire power plant mostly fgd gypsum be apply in cement and wallboard industry also it can be use in agricultural activity for soil amendment but the amount of fgd waste use in this function be still low furthermore biochar have long be use to improve soil fertility the positive impact of biochar amendment on soil be that it can increase soil capacity to adsorb plant nutrient decrease soil bulk density increase plant available water retention and so on in thailand some area like nan province have a problem of soil degradation from deforestation and excess use of chemical fertilizer with the benefit of these fgd waste and biochar the study of soil amendment will be perform by use degraded soil therefore this research be aim to apply fgd waste couple with biochar to improve soil quality from degraded soil in nan province also the objective of this work be to evaluate the effect of fgd waste and biochar on soil property such as ph electrical conductivity ec bulk density and soil texture the concentration of fgd waste and biochar be range from and by weight respectively the result present that the soil quality have be improve in that ph can increase from up to the soil texture have change in the well quality from clay to silty loam or loam furthermore the bulk density of soil be reduce in order to have more space for air and water for all mixture which be conducive to plant growth consequently this research can contribute to the improvement of degraded soil property to fit well for agriculture and the result can be apply for practice in the real field
296,Patient food delivery error in the hospital: A case study in Thailand,"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.Food service provided in hospitals has considerable significance, as it is part of the medical treatment. In a sample hospital, food delivery error occupied 37.4% which was the highest complaint among all problems in 2017. This problem has never been investigated for its root causes and there has been no measures established against it. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate for the causes of the discrepancies in the food service provided for the inpatients. Root causes of the inpatient food delivery error are identified by triangulation of quantitative data by survey & complaint analysis and qualitative data by focus group. The first set consists of questionnaire responded by nutrition unit staff, experts in food service and hospital directors, in total of 71 respondents. The questionnaire was modelled after the four types of medication errors[1], [2]. The second set was the review of the food service error from inpatient complaint files recorded during January-December 2017. The third set was focus group interview among 71 hospital staff. The service blueprint was used in search of the pain points. The three methods showed consensus results. Both survey and complaint results revealed that the error were caused by 1)transcribing (61.3%, 54.3%) 2) administration error (25.8%,32.6%) 3) dispensing error (10.1%, 10.9%) 4) prescription error(2.7%, 2.2%). Furthermore, the survey of the relation between themeans of importance and the actual performance in each processrevealed that transcribing error and administration error were theroot causes at 95% confidence level. In addition, focus groupinterview with the 71 hospital staff confirms the finding.Transcribing error included miscommunication and datatransference across the departments.

The results revealed that the storage modulus at room temperature increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker, that is, from 5.1 GPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 8.8 GPa (at 20 wt%). Glass transition temperatures were increased with increasing silicon carbide whisker in the range of 154°C–170°C. Furthermore, all samples exhibited approximately 99% of shape fixity with recovery time ranging from 8 to 27 min. Interestingly, the incorporation of silicon carbide whisker could significantly increase recovery stress from 3.4 MPa (without silicon carbide whisker) to 11.2 MPa (at 20 wt%). Moreover, the addition of silicon carbide whisker provides microwave actuating ability to the sample. Recovery time under microwave heating was significantly shortened to be in a range of 3–5 min. These results suggest potential use of the composites as microwave-responsive sensors and other shape memory devices.","['METAL', 'ME', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",recovery stress enhancement in shape memory composite from silicon carbide whisker fill benzoxazine epoxy polymer alloy the author s in this research the benzoxazine epoxy shape memory polymer with outstanding recovery stress improvement be prepare by fill with highly adamantine silicon carbide whisker at wt the result reveal that the storage modulus at room temperature increase with increase silicon carbide whisker that be from gpa without silicon carbide whisker to gpa at wt glass transition temperature be increase with increase silicon carbide whisker in the range of c c furthermore all sample exhibit approximately of shape fixity with recovery time range from to min interestingly the incorporation of silicon carbide whisker could significantly increase recovery stress from mpa without silicon carbide whisker to mpa at wt moreover the addition of silicon carbide whisker provide microwave actuate ability to the sample recovery time under microwave heating be significantly shorten to be in a range of min these result suggest potential use of the composite as microwave responsive sensor and other shape memory device

300,Inventory Management System Development in a Flexible Printed Circuit Board Manufacturer,"© 2019 IEEE.This research attempted to develop an inventory management system for a flexible printed circuit board manufacturer in Thailand. The development began with an investigation of the existing inventory system, which found that the system was quite ineffective causing companies to face serious problems particularly an excessive inventory. The ABC analysis using a multiple criteria inventory classification for the inventory control system was initially applied to identify the most important items. Twenty-seven items were selected to demonstrate the mechanism of the new proposed system. The main objectives are to focus the efficient forecasting technique under stochastic demand and the introduction of fixed replenishment quantity policy to reduce the overall inventory related cost. (R,Q) policy is applied on the forecast demands using the seasonal naive, holt-winters exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average and afterwards a comparative analysis is conducted on assessing the accuracy of forecasts of demand forecasting technique, it is conventional to use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). In the implementation process, the proposed system was compared with the current system.

301,An enhanced deep convolutional encoder-decoder network for road segmentation on aerial imagery,"© Springer International Publishing AG 2018.Object classification from images is among the many practical examples where deep learning algorithms have successfully been applied. In this paper, we present an improved deep convolutional encoder-decoder network (DCED) for segmenting road objects from aerial images. Several aspects of the proposed method are enhanced, incl. incorporation of ELU (exponential linear unit)—as opposed to ReLU (rectified linear unit) that typically outperforms ELU in most object classification cases; amplification of datasets by adding incrementally-rotated images with eight different angles in the training corpus (this eliminates the limitation that the number of training aerial images is usually limited), thus the number of training datasets is increased by eight times; and lastly, adoption of landscape metrics to further improve the overall quality of results by removing false road objects. The most recent DCED approach for object segmentation, namely SegNet, is used as one of the benchmarks in evaluating our method. The experiments were conducted on a well-known aerial imagery, Massachusetts roads dataset (Mass. Roads), which is publicly available. The results showed that our method outperforms all of the baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores.","['CE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'OPTIC']",an enhanced deep convolutional encoder decoder network for road segmentation on aerial imagery springer international publishing ag object classification from image be among the many practical example where deep learn algorithm have successfully be apply in this paper we present an improved deep convolutional encoder decoder network dce for segment road object from aerial image several aspect of the propose method be enhance incl incorporation of elu exponential linear unit as oppose to relu rectify linear unit that typically outperform elu in most object classification case amplification of dataset by add incrementally rotate image with eight different angle in the training corpus this eliminate the limitation that the number of training aerial image be usually limit thus the number of training dataset be increase by eight time and lastly adoption of landscape metric to far improve the overall quality of result by remove false road object the most recent dced approach for object segmentation namely segnet be use as one of the benchmark in evaluate our method the experiment be conduct on a well know aerial imagery massachusetts road dataset mass road which be publicly available the result show that our method outperform all of the baseline in term of precision recall and f score

Most of the tools apply Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) to visualize the activities and their dependencies among various project activities but these tools do not provide semantic representation. Thus, it still requires an implicit knowledge of project managers to analyze and manage scheduling tasks.

For comparison purposes, the SSP supported Ni catalysts were also prepared by impregnation method (Ni/SSP (Imp)). All the prepared catalysts showed spherical shape with high specific surface area (357-868 m2/g). The X-ray diffraction and H2-temperature programmed reduction results revealed the stronger interaction between Ni and SiO2 in the form of nickel silicate for all the Ni-doped SSP catalysts except Ni/SSP (imp), in which only NiO species were detected. For the reaction temperature 350 ̊C, the CO2 conversion was in the order: Ni_Alt_Si (51%) > Ni1_Si2 (49%) > Si1_Ni2 (28%) > Ni/SSP (Imp) (10%) with methane selectivity 80–95%.

Firstly, the spatial averaging is used to reduce the variance of solar irradiance prediction over a spatial area of interest. Secondly, a model output statistics method which is a linear regression model, is applied to explain relationships between solar irradiance and relevant weather variables. In this study, we perform a variable selection based on three statistical methods: partial correlation, stepwise regression, and subset regression, to specify the important meteorological variables for solar irradiance prediction in Thailand. The results show that spatial averaging of NWP forecasts over 7×7 grid points provides a reduction of 3.42% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) from NWP forecasts. Model output statistics with and without variable selection can further improve output from spatial averaging by 41.32% and 41.89% NRMSE respectively. We conclude that highly relevant variables including irradiance measurements, ambient temperature, relative humidity, UV index, and NWP forecasts are sufficient f or a s ignificant improvement of NWP forecasts in Thailand.","['ENV', 'MATH']",influential variable selection for improve solar forecast from numerical weather prediction ieeethis paper present two statistical method for refine p redicte s olar I rradiance f rom n umerical weather prediction nwp firstly the spatial averaging be use to reduce the variance of solar irradiance prediction over a spatial area of interest secondly a model output statistic method which be a linear regression model be apply to explain relationship between solar irradiance and relevant weather variable in this study we perform a variable selection base on three statistical method partial correlation stepwise regression and subset regression to specify the important meteorological variable for solar irradiance prediction in thailand the result show that spatial averaging of nwp forecast over grid point provide a reduction of normalize root mean square error nrmse from nwp forecast model output statistic with and without variable selection can far improve output from spatial averaging by and nrmse respectively we conclude that highly relevant variable include irradiance measurement ambient temperature relative humidity uv index and nwp forecast be sufficient f or a s ignificant improvement of nwp forecast in thailand
306,Effect of calcination temperature on mg-al layered double hydroxides (LDH) as promising catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde,"© 2019 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) and their differently calcined derivative catalysts was investigated in this study. The Mg-Al catalysts were synthesized via co-precipitation method and calcined at different temperatures at 450℃, 600℃ and 900℃. It revealed that the calcination temperature affected the physicochemical properties and the catalytic activity of these catalysts toward the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol. It was found that ethanol conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature from 200 to 400℃, whereas acetaldehyde selectivity decreased. At low reaction temperature (200-300℃), the non-calcined catalyst (Mg-Al-000) showed the highest ethanol conversion, which can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups on surface having acetaldehyde as a major product. The calcination process led to formation of mixed oxide phase in Mg-Al catalysts as proven by the XRD and FT-IR results. The catalyst calcined at 450℃ (Mg-Al-450) exhibited the highest basicity as measured by the CO 2 -TPD with ethanol conversion of 45.8% and acetaldehyde yield of 29.7% at 350℃.","['METAL', 'CHE']",effect of calcination temperature on mg al layer double hydroxide ldh as promise catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by japan oil chemist society oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over mg al layer double hydroxide ldh and their differently calcine derivative catalyst be investigate in this study the mg al catalyst be synthesize via co precipitation method and calcine at different temperature at and it reveal that the calcination temperature affect the physicochemical property and the catalytic activity of these catalyst toward the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol it be find that ethanol conversion increase with increase reaction temperature from to whereas acetaldehyde selectivity decrease at low reaction temperature the non calcine catalyst mg al show the high ethanol conversion which can be attribute to the hydroxyl group on surface have acetaldehyde as a major product the calcination process lead to formation of mixed oxide phase in mg al catalyst as prove by the xrd and ft ir result the catalyst calcine at mg al exhibit the high basicity as measure by the co tpd with ethanol conversion of and acetaldehyde yield of at

309,Enhancement of uranium recovery from seawater using amidoximated polymer gel synthesized from radiation-polymerization and crosslinking of acrylonitrile and methacrylic acid monomers,"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.The amidoximated polymer gel for uranium recovery from natural seawater was successfully synthesized from radiation-polymerization and crosslinking of acrylonitrile (AN) and methacrylic acid (MAA) monomers with N,N'-Methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) as the crosslink agent. The optimum condition to prepare the polymer gel is: the gamma ray dose of 40kGy, the AN:MAA ratio of 80:20, and the crosslink agent concentration of 8g/L. The polymer gel can be reused for at least 8 times without significant performance decrease. The kinetic of seawater absorption by the adsorbent was quite rapid, reaching the equilibrium swelling ratio of approximately 250% in about 30min. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with only 300 and 840ppb of added uranium for 4 weeks, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 6.96 and 9.64mg/g, respectively. By submersion of this polymer gel in the seawater sample with 30 and 2140ppm of added uranium for 1 week, the adsorption capacity reached as much as 334 and 409mg/g, respectively. This high-efficiency amidoxime polymer gel offers a possibility of being utilized as a seawater uranium recovery agent on an industrial scale. Suitable elution conditions to minimize mass loss as well as suitable locations with clear seawater and no algae growth will need to be identified.

It was found that with the increasing addition of RHA causes the decrease of compressive strength and density of mortars. Compressive strength of mortar drops with addition of RHA, from a value of 42 MPa of no RHA addition, to 24 MPa of 15wt% RHA addition. Reduction in compression strength may be due to the decrease in density, which arises from porous RHA. This is more dominant in mortar made from addition of RHA without prior acid treated. Carbon residue and impurity in RHA further reduce the compressive strength of mortar.

312,"Isothermal cold crystallization kinetics and properties of thermoformed poly(lactic acid) composites: effects of talc, calcium carbonate, cassava starch and silane coupling agents","© 2020, Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute.The effects of three different fillers (i.e., talc, calcium carbonate, and cassava starch) and surface functionalization by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) on morphology, thermal and tensile properties of the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites were comparatively examined. Dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed that the incorporation of filler can facilitate the cold crystallization of PLA, as confirmed by lowered cold crystallization temperature. By fitting DSC data with Avrami model, the highest isothermal cold crystallization rate constant k and the shortest crystallization half time t1/2 were obtained for the PLA/talc composites under isothermal temperature of 100 °C, implying that talc was the most effective nucleating agent for PLA in this study. The average Avrami index n of neat PLA and its composites lay within the same range of 3.0–3.6, which reflected the three-dimensional spherulitic growth of PLA with the mixture of instantaneous nuclei and sporadic nuclei. In comparison with the composite cast films, the thermoformed films had higher degree of crystallinity as well as higher tensile strength and Young’s modulus owing to the chain orientation upon annealing. Furthermore, the addition of silane-treated talc, especially APTES-treated talc, fastened cold crystallization rate and enhanced tensile properties because of the improved interfacial interaction between talc particles and PLA matrix.","['PE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",isothermal cold crystallization kinetic and property of thermoformed poly lactic acid composite effect of talc calcium carbonate cassava starch and silane couple agent iran polymer and petrochemical institute the effect of three different filler I e talc calcium carbonate and cassava starch and surface functionalization by aminopropyltriethoxysilane apte and vinyltriethoxysilane vte on morphology thermal and tensile property of the poly lactic acid pla composite be comparatively examine dynamic differential scan calorimetry dsc result reveal that the incorporation of filler can facilitate the cold crystallization of pla as confirm by lower cold crystallization temperature by fitting dsc datum with avrami model the high isothermal cold crystallization rate constant k and the short crystallization half time t be obtain for the pla talc composite under isothermal temperature of c imply that talc be the most effective nucleating agent for pla in this study the average avrami index n of neat pla and its composite lie within the same range of which reflect the three dimensional spherulitic growth of pla with the mixture of instantaneous nucleus and sporadic nucleus in comparison with the composite cast film the thermoformed film have high degree of crystallinity as well as high tensile strength and young s modulus owe to the chain orientation upon anneal furthermore the addition of silane treat talc especially apte treat talc fasten cold crystallization rate and enhanced tensile property because of the improve interfacial interaction between talc particle and pla matrix
313,Ontology-Based Naive Bayes Short Text Classification Method for a Small Dataset,"© 2019 IEEE.Content less than two hundred words like comments or review statements is known as a short text. Short text classification is useful for automatically categorizing sentence into predefined group. There are several traditional short text classification methods by using bag-of-words with k nearest neighbors (k-NN), Naïve Bayes, Maximum entropy, support vector machines (SVMs), and an algorithm based on statistics and rules. The deep learning method is outperformed other methods on classification of short text with normal size of dataset. Some researches classify requirements into functional and nonfunctional requirements. There is no research on multi-classification of functional requirements with a small dataset particularly for an accounting field. This paper presents an approach to classify short text for a small dataset into multiple categories of functional requirements on the accounting domain. The proposed approach uses an ontology to construct bag-of-words and uses Naive Bayes to classify for small dataset. The experiment is conducted using four hundred of datasets with 5folds and 10-folds cross-validation. The result shows that the method can correctly classify more than 80%. Additionally, comparisons between the ontology-based Naive Bayes method and other methods are investigated.","['EE', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'EDU', 'MATH']",ontology base naive baye short text classification method for a small dataset ieee content less than two hundred word like comment or review statement be know as a short text short text classification be useful for automatically categorize sentence into predefine group there be several traditional short text classification method by use bag of word with k near neighbor k nn naïve bayes maximum entropy support vector machine svms and an algorithm base on statistic and rule the deep learning method be outperform other method on classification of short text with normal size of dataset some research classify requirement into functional and nonfunctional requirement there be no research on multi classification of functional requirement with a small dataset particularly for an accounting field this paper present an approach to classify short text for a small dataset into multiple category of functional requirement on the accounting domain the propose approach use an ontology to construct bag of word and use naive baye to classify for small dataset the experiment be conduct use four hundred of dataset with fold and fold cross validation the result show that the method can correctly classify more than additionally comparison between the ontology base naive baye method and other method be investigate
314,Design equations of uplift capacity of circular piles in sands,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdUplift capacity of circular piles in sands is one important design parameter for many pile foundations supporting important structures subjected to tensile forces. Even though a number of formulas based on the limit equilibrium or semi-empirical methods are proposed to predict the uplift capacity of piles in sands, there is a major limitation of the methods in obtaining the accurate predictions. In this paper, the computational limit analysis is employed to investigate the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands. The effects of the important variables including pile length and diameter, soil friction angle and unit weight, and roughness factor at soil-pile interface are examined extensively using the dimensionless parameters while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with the parameters are discussed and compared. Approximate statistical design equations of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands are developed based on the numerically derived solutions and the existing experimental data. It is found that the proposed design equations provide the most accurate prediction of the uplift capacity of circular piles in sands as compared to the existing formulas.","['CE', 'PE', 'MATH']",design equation of uplift capacity of circular pile in sand elsevi ltduplift capacity of circular pile in sand be one important design parameter for many pile foundation support important structure subject to tensile force even though a number of formula base on the limit equilibrium or semi empirical method be propose to predict the uplift capacity of pile in sand there be a major limitation of the method in obtain the accurate prediction in this paper the computational limit analysis be employ to investigate the uplift capacity of circular pile in sand the effect of the important variable include pile length and diameter soil friction angle and unit weight and roughness factor at soil pile interface be examine extensively use the dimensionless parameter while the predict failure mechanism associate with the parameter be discuss and compare approximate statistical design equation of the uplift capacity of circular pile in sand be develop base on the numerically derive solution and the exist experimental datum it be find that the propose design equation provide the most accurate prediction of the uplift capacity of circular pile in sand as compare to the exist formula
315,Effect of gamma irradiation on properties of ultrafine rubbers as toughening filler in polybenzoxazine,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThree types of ultrafine fully vulcanized powdered rubbers (UFRs), i.e. natural rubber (NR), carboxylated nitrile-butadiene rubber (XNBR), and carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber (XSBR) were prepared by combined technology between gamma irradiation for crosslinking and spray drying. The effects of doses in a range of 0–250 kGy on swelling ratio, crosslink density, and thermal stability of UFRs were investigated. Smaller particle size of UFRs was obtained at higher dose. A decrease in the swelling ratio and an increase in crosslink density were well corresponded to crosslinking effect related with absorbed dose. The increase in dose was also found to improve thermal performance of URFs. The influence of irradiated UFRs on impact resistance and glass transition temperature (Tg) of polybenzoxazine composites was also evaluated. The highest impact resistance of the composites belonged to the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 200 kGy. While the significantly enhanced Tg of the composite was obtained by an addition of irradiated UFRs with higher doses, i.e. Tg = 173 °C for the composite filled with irradiated UFXNBR at 250 kGy. As a consequence, the UFRs can be used to effectively modify thermal and mechanical properties, especially impact resistance of polybenzoxazine composites.","['ME', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",effect of gamma irradiation on property of ultrafine rubber as toughening filler in polybenzoxazine elsevi ltdthree type of ultrafine fully vulcanize powdered rubber ufrs I e natural rubber nr carboxylate nitrile butadiene rubber xnbr and carboxylate styrene butadiene rubber xsbr be prepare by combined technology between gamma irradiation for crosslinke and spray dry the effect of dose in a range of kgy on swell ratio crosslink density and thermal stability of ufrs be investigate small particle size of ufrs be obtain at high dose a decrease in the swell ratio and an increase in crosslink density be well correspond to crosslinke effect relate with absorbed dose the increase in dose be also find to improve thermal performance of urf the influence of irradiate ufrs on impact resistance and glass transition temperature tg of polybenzoxazine composite be also evaluate the high impact resistance of the composite belong to the composite fill with irradiated ufxnbr at kgy while the significantly enhance tg of the composite be obtain by an addition of irradiated ufrs with high dose I e tg c for the composite fill with irradiated ufxnbr at kgy as a consequence the ufrs can be use to effectively modify thermal and mechanical property especially impact resistance of polybenzoxazine composite

318,Solar power forecast with weather classification using self-organized map,"© 2017 IEEE.This paper presents a practically efficient method for 1h to 3h ahead solar power forecast (SPF) with weather classification using a Self-Organized Map (SOM). The method requires minimal input data which are normally monitored at all sites so that additional expensive weather observatory devices are not necessary. The proposed SOM can classify weather condition into sunny, cloudy and rainy day, using only the current and past irradiance profile data as input. Then, the ANN-based SPF model for each weather condition is constructed, trained and validated, accordingly. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated using actual field data from the 500-kW solar farm in Mae Hong Son district, Thailand. Accuracy performance obtained indicates that additional spinning reserve of less than 10 %, with respect to the installed solar power capacity, would be required when the proposed SPF method is applied to the energy management system (EMS) for the city.","['ENV', 'PE', 'EE']",solar power forecast with weather classification use self organize map ieee this paper present a practically efficient method for h to h ahead solar power forecast spf with weather classification use a self organize map som the method require minimal input datum which be normally monitor at all site so that additional expensive weather observatory device be not necessary the propose som can classify weather condition into sunny cloudy and rainy day use only the current and past irradiance profile datum as input then the ann base spf model for each weather condition be construct train and validate accordingly performance of the propose method have be evaluate use actual field datum from the kw solar farm in mae hong son district thailand accuracy performance obtain indicate that additional spinning reserve of less than with respect to the installed solar power capacity would be require when the propose spf method be apply to the energy management system em for the city
319,Hydrogen Production via Chemical Looping Steam Reforming of Ethanol: Effect of Ce and la on Ni-based Oxygen Carrier Performance,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Chemical looping steam reforming of ethanol for hydrogen production has been studied. In this process, the high hydrogen content compound, ethanol, was reacted with steam and oxygen carriers (OCs) through the redox reaction cycle to produce the clean fuel H2. The effects of the different promoters, CeO2 and La2O3, in Al2O3-supported Ni-based OCs were investigated. The mixed promoters Ni-Al2O3 OCs were synthesized by wet impregnation method. The fresh OCs were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and Scanning electron microscope/Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) technique. The redox activity test was performed in a fixed bed reactor by alternating between fuel and air feeds at isothermal condition of 500°C. The fuel feed was composed of ethanol and steam with steam to ethanol (S/E) mole ratio of 3. It was found that addition of CeO2 and La2O3 on Ni/Al2O3 improved the metal dispersion, reduced the crystallite size and enhanced reducibility of NiO. The La2O3 promoted (Ni/La2O3-Al2O3) and CeO2 and La2O3 co-promoted (Ni/La2O3-CeO2-Al2O3) OCs showed high performance and stability in chemical looping steam reforming of ethanol with the maximum ethanol conversion of 98.3 and 92.5 %, respectively, with maximum H2 yield of 2.9 and 3.2 mol/mol ethanol, respectively. In addition, forming of La2O3-CeO2 solid solution phase in Ni/La2O3-CeO2-Al2O3 oxygen carriers enhanced the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and high oxygen mobility (OM) of OCs, resulting in a lower carbon deposition.","['PE', 'METAL', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",hydrogen production via chemical loop steam reforming of ethanol effect of ce and la on ni base oxygen carrier performance publish under licence by iop publish ltd chemical loop steam reforming of ethanol for hydrogen production have be study in this process the high hydrogen content compound ethanol be react with steam and oxygen carrier oc through the redox reaction cycle to produce the clean fuel h the effect of the different promoter ceo and la o in al o support ni base oc be investigate the mixed promoter ni al o ocs be synthesize by wet impregnation method the fresh ocs be characterize by x ray powder diffraction xrd n adsorption desorption h temperature program reduction h tpr and scan electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx technique the redox activity test be perform in a fix bed reactor by alternate between fuel and air feed at isothermal condition of c the fuel feed be compose of ethanol and steam with steam to ethanol s e mole ratio of it be find that addition of ceo and la o on ni al o improve the metal dispersion reduce the crystallite size and enhance reducibility of nio the la o promote ni la o al o and ceo and la o co promote ni la o ceo al o ocs show high performance and stability in chemical loop steam reforming of ethanol with the maximum ethanol conversion of and respectively with maximum h yield of and mol mol ethanol respectively in addition form of la o ceo solid solution phase in ni la o ceo al o oxygen carrier enhance the oxygen storage capacity osc and high oxygen mobility om of ocs result in a low carbon deposition

321,A review on the electrolyte imbalance in vanadium redox flow batteries,"© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCVanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are widely used in various stationary applications to enhance power management, improve peak shaving and load leveling, and support a renewable power grid. Although a VRFB has several advantages such as flexibility, long shelf life, and relatively high efficiency, there are very few commercially available VRFB systems because of high operating and structure costs. Therefore, considerable efforts are being made to reduce the fixed and variable costs of a VRFB system. For effective handling of the VRFB system, it is essential to understand the operational problems that could occur during a long-term VRFB operation. Electrolyte imbalance is often a major obstacle affecting the battery capacity loss. This paper presents a comprehensive reviews on causes, effects, measurement, and regeneration of the imbalanced electrolyte leading to an understanding for better operation and to manufacture a VRFB commercial system.","['PE', 'METAL', 'EE', 'CHE']",a review on the electrolyte imbalance in vanadium redox flow battery hydrogen energy publication llcvanadium redox flow battery vrfb be widely use in various stationary application to enhance power management improve peak shaving and load leveling and support a renewable power grid although a vrfb have several advantage such as flexibility long shelf life and relatively high efficiency there be very few commercially available vrfb system because of high operating and structure cost therefore considerable effort be be make to reduce the fixed and variable cost of a vrfb system for effective handling of the vrfb system it be essential to understand the operational problem that could occur during a long term vrfb operation electrolyte imbalance be often a major obstacle affect the battery capacity loss this paper present a comprehensive review on cause effect measurement and regeneration of the imbalanced electrolyte lead to an understanding for well operation and to manufacture a vrfb commercial system
322,Size effects in two-dimensional layered materials modeled by couple stress elasticity,"© 2021, Higher Education Press.In the present study, the effect of material microstructure on the mechanical response of a two-dimensional elastic layer perfectly bonded to a substrate is examined under surface loadings. In the current model, the substrate is treated as an elastic half plane as opposed to a rigid base, and this enables its applications in practical cases when the modulus of the layer (e.g., the coating material) and substrate (e.g., the coated surface) are comparable. The material microstructure is modeled using the generalized continuum theory of couple stress elasticity. The boundary value problems are formulated in terms of the displacement field and solved in an analytical manner via the Fourier transform and stiffness matrix method. The results demonstrate the capability of the present continuum theory to efficiently model the size-dependency of the response of the material when the external and internal length scales are comparable. Furthermore, the results indicated that the material mismatch and substrate stiffness play a crucial role in the predicted elastic field. Specifically, the study also addresses significant discrepancy of the response for the case of a layer resting on a rigid substrate.","['MATH', 'MATSCI']",size effect in two dimensional layered material model by couple stress elasticity high education press in the present study the effect of material microstructure on the mechanical response of a two dimensional elastic layer perfectly bond to a substrate be examine under surface loading in the current model the substrate be treat as an elastic half plane as oppose to a rigid base and this enable its application in practical case when the modulus of the layer e g the coating material and substrate e g the coated surface be comparable the material microstructure be model use the generalized continuum theory of couple stress elasticity the boundary value problem be formulate in term of the displacement field and solve in an analytical manner via the fouri transform and stiffness matrix method the result demonstrate the capability of the present continuum theory to efficiently model the size dependency of the response of the material when the external and internal length scale be comparable furthermore the result indicate that the material mismatch and substrate stiffness play a crucial role in the predict elastic field specifically the study also address significant discrepancy of the response for the case of a layer rest on a rigid substrate
323,Assessment of reservoir trapping efficiency and hydropower production under future projections of sedimentation in Lancang–Mekong River Basin,"© 2023 Elsevier LtdSedimentation poses a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of hydropower generation. However, there is a lack of studies examining the relationship between sediment trapping efficiency and electricity generation on a basin-wide scale over time. This study aims to assess the efficiency of hydropower production in terms of reservoir sediment trapping. Modified Brune's method examined the relationship between trapped sediments in reservoirs and hydropower production, considering sediment projections for the near future. We divided the cases of existing and planned reservoirs in the mainstream river and subbasins to assess cumulative sediment trapping. Using the Lancang-Mekong River Basin as a case study, the following main findings were observed. Firstly, the existing reservoirs, under baseline conditions (2018), had the potential to trap approximately 60.9% or 82 Mt/yr of the total sediment load. Secondly, around 69% or 110 Mt/yr of the total sediments could be significantly trapped when considering the existing reservoirs and those planned according to the development plan of riparian countries. Thirdly, the hydropower production efficiency of most reservoirs in 2030 and 2040 experienced a significant decline of approximately 10%–20% and more than 30%, respectively. Therefore, sediment management is crucial for maintaining efficient hydropower production and achieving sustainable hydropower development through effective planning strategies.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'IE']",assessment of reservoir trap efficiency and hydropower production under future projection of sedimentation in lancang mekong river basin elsevi ltdsedimentation pose a significant threat to the long term sustainability of hydropower generation however there be a lack of study examine the relationship between sediment trap efficiency and electricity generation on a basin wide scale over time this study aim to assess the efficiency of hydropower production in term of reservoir sediment trap modify brune s method examine the relationship between trap sediment in reservoir and hydropower production consider sediment projection for the near future we divide the case of exist and plan reservoir in the mainstream river and subbasin to assess cumulative sediment trap use the lancang mekong river basin as a case study the follow main finding be observe firstly the exist reservoir under baseline condition have the potential to trap approximately or mt yr of the total sediment load secondly around or mt yr of the total sediment could be significantly trap when consider the exist reservoir and those plan accord to the development plan of riparian country thirdly the hydropower production efficiency of most reservoir in and experience a significant decline of approximately and more than respectively therefore sediment management be crucial for maintain efficient hydropower production and achieve sustainable hydropower development through effective planning strategy

326,Influence of phosphoric acid modification on catalytic properties of Al2O3 catalysts for dehydration of ethanol to diethyl ether,"Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.In this present work, diethyl ether, which is currently served as promising alternative fuel for diesel engines, was produced via catalytic dehydration of ethanol over H3PO4-modified - Al2O3 catalysts. The impact of H3PO4 addition on catalytic performance and characteristics of catalysts was investigated. While catalytic dehydration of ethanol was performed in a fixed-bed microreactor at the temperature ranging from 200 ºC to 400 ºC under atmospheric pressure, catalyst characterization was conducted by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results showed that although the H3PO4 addition tended to decrease surface area of catalyst resulting in the reduction of ethanol conversion, the Al2O3 containing 5 wt% of phosphorus (5P/Al2O3) was the most suitable catalyst for the catalytic dehydration of ethanol to diethyl ether since it exhibited the highest catalytic ability regarding diethyl ether yield and the quantity of coke formation as well as it had similar long-term stability to conventional Al2O3 catalyst.

328,Public transport driver identification system using histogram of acceleration data,"© 2019 Nuttun Virojboonkiate et al.This paper introduces a driver identification system architecture for public transport which utilizes only acceleration sensor data. The system architecture consists of three main modules which are the data collection, data preprocessing, and driver identification module. Data were collected from real operation of campus shuttle buses. In the data preprocessing module, a filtering module is proposed to remove the inactive period of the public transport data. To extract the unique behavior of the driver, a histogram of acceleration sensor data is proposed as a main feature of driver identification. The performance of our system is evaluated in many important aspects, considering axis of acceleration, sliding window size, number of drivers, classifier algorithms, and driving period. Additionally, the case study of impostor detection is implemented by modifying the driver identification module to identify a car thief or carjacking. Our driver identification system can achieve up to 99% accuracy and the impostor detection system can achieve the F1 score of 0.87. As a result, our system architecture can be used as a guideline for implementing the real driver identification system and further driver identification researches.",['CPE'],public transport driver identification system use histogram of acceleration datum nuttun virojboonkiate et al this paper introduce a driver identification system architecture for public transport which utilize only acceleration sensor data the system architecture consist of three main module which be the datum collection datum preprocesse and driver identification module datum be collect from real operation of campus shuttle bus in the datum preprocesse module a filter module be propose to remove the inactive period of the public transport datum to extract the unique behavior of the driver a histogram of acceleration sensor datum be propose as a main feature of driver identification the performance of our system be evaluate in many important aspect consider axis of acceleration slide window size number of driver classifier algorithm and drive period additionally the case study of impostor detection be implement by modify the driver identification module to identify a car thief or carjack our driver identification system can achieve up to accuracy and the impostor detection system can achieve the f score of as a result our system architecture can be use as a guideline for implement the real driver identification system and further driver identification research
329,"Effect of transition metal dopants (M= Nb, La, Zr, and Y) on the M-TiO2 supported V2O5 catalysts in the selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur","© 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.P-25 TiO2 was modified by a small amount addition of different transition metal dopants (Nb, La, Zr, and Y) and employed as the supports for preparation of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the selective H2S oxidation at low temperature (130 °C). The H2S removal capability was ranged in the order: V2O5/Y-TiO2 > V2O5/Zr-TiO2 V2O5/TiO2 > V2O5/La-TiO2 > V2O5/Nb-TiO2, which corresponded well to the chemically adsorbed oxygen on oxygen vacancies at catalyst surface (or surface oxygen) as revealed by XPS results. The Y addition could promote the oxygen vacancies formation because of the Ti4+ substitution by less valence Y3+ cations, leading to the improvement of H2S conversion. Whereas the modification by dopants, which have the extra valence cations or larger ionic radius (i.e., Nb or La) suppressed the oxygen vacancies formation, thus leading to lower activity. Despite the stronger interaction between V and Zr-TiO2, the amount of surface oxygen and H2S conversion of the V2O5/Zr-TiO2 were less than the V2O5/Y-TiO2, suggesting that although the formation of oxygen vacancies depended on the interaction between V and M-TiO2, the effect of Ti4+ substitution by transition metal dopant was more pronounced than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. The H2S removal capability corresponded well to the oxygen vacancies being formed more than the degree of interaction between V and M-TiO2. From this study, the V2O5/Y-TiO2 showed the highest H2S conversion at ∼77% with low SO2 formation (less than 10 ppm).","['METAL', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",effect of transition metal dopant m nb la zr and y on the m tio support v o catalyst in the selective oxidation of h s to elemental sulfur publish by elsevi ltd p tio be modify by a small amount addition of different transition metal dopant nb la zr and y and employ as the support for preparation of the v o tio catalyst for the selective h s oxidation at low temperature c the h s removal capability be range in the order v o y tio v o zr tio v o tio v o la tio v o nb tio which correspond well to the chemically adsorb oxygen on oxygen vacancy at catalyst surface or surface oxygen as reveal by xps result the y addition could promote the oxygen vacancy formation because of the ti substitution by less valence y cation lead to the improvement of h s conversion whereas the modification by dopant which have the extra valence cation or large ionic radius I e nb or la suppress the oxygen vacancy formation thus lead to low activity despite the strong interaction between v and zr tio the amount of surface oxygen and h s conversion of the v o zr tio be less than the v o y tio suggest that although the formation of oxygen vacancy depend on the interaction between v and m tio the effect of ti substitution by transition metal dopant be more pronounced than the degree of interaction between v and m tio the h s removal capability correspond well to the oxygen vacancy be form more than the degree of interaction between v and m tio from this study the v o y tio show the high h s conversion at with low so formation less than ppm

The experimental isobaric vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the binary systems of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) + n-dodecane and tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) + n-dodecane were measured at pressures of 0.13, 2.40 and 6.67 kPa, using a glass vapor-liquid equilibrium ebulliometer. VLE data were generated in the form of T−x−y diagrams and checked for thermodynamic consistency via Herington area test and Van Ness point test. Data for all mixtures met the criteria of thermodynamic consistency and were found suitable for process modeling. At each pressure point, no azeotropic phenomenon was observed. Reduction in pressure of the system can significantly enhance the relative volatility and separation efficiency of both mixtures. At all pressure points, D2EHPA was noted to be more separable than TBP.

All rights reserved.Recently, rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZBs) have attracted extensive interest due to their safety, abundance, low cost, and low toxicity. However, aqueous electrolytes require a polymeric binder to prevent dissolution of the active material in addition to its binding properties. This study highlights binder-free, centimeter long, single-crystal, V2O5 nanofibers (BCS-VONF) on carbon cloth, as the cathode material for AZBs synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal process. BCS-VONF in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2 exhibit promising electrochemical performance with excellent capacity retention. Even in the absence of a binder, BCS-VONF were found to be very stable in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2. They will not yield to the dissolution and detachment of the active material on the current collector.

336,Modified response spectrum analysis to compute shear force in tall RC shear wall buildings,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdAmong various analysis methods, response spectrum analysis (RSA) is widely used to compute design forces of structures subjected to earthquake loading. Previous studies indicate that using a single response modification factor (R) to reduce elastic forces contributed from all modes in the RSA procedure is the primary cause for underestimating the design force demands on structures. In this paper, two modified response spectrum analysis (MRSA) methods, MRSAHE based on a higher-mode elastic approach and MRSAHI based on a higher-mode inelastic approach are proposed for computing design shear forces in tall reinforced concrete (RC) shear wall buildings. Here 15-, 20-, 31-, and 39-story tall buildings subjected to earthquake excitations in Bangkok are first designed using the RSA procedure, and then nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA) is carried out. It is found that the RSA procedure provides good estimates for floor displacements and story drift ratios, but significantly underestimates force demands, when compared with NLRHA. The MRSAHE method provides good estimates of shear force for the 15- and 20-story buildings and conservative estimates for the 31- and 39-story buildings; while the MRSAHI method provides good estimates for all cases. However, MRSAHI requires a nonlinear inelastic structural model but MRSAHE does not. In both MRSA methods, the bending moment demands are computed in the same way as the conventional RSA procedure, with ductile detailing in RC walls or columns required at locations where the combined axial and bending strain exceeds a certain limit. In order to determine the locations that require ductile detailing in RC walls or columns, a novel method based on the equal displacement concept using strain from elastic analysis to predict inelastic strain is found to provide good agreement with inelastic strain computed from NLRHA.","['CE', 'PE']",modify response spectrum analysis to compute shear force in tall rc shear wall building elsevi ltdamong various analysis method response spectrum analysis rsa be widely use to compute design force of structure subject to earthquake load previous study indicate that use a single response modification factor r to reduce elastic force contribute from all mode in the rsa procedure be the primary cause for underestimate the design force demand on structure in this paper two modify response spectrum analysis mrsa method mrsahe base on a high mode elastic approach and mrsahi base on a high mode inelastic approach be propose for compute design shear force in tall reinforce concrete rc shear wall building here and story tall building subject to earthquake excitation in bangkok be first design use the rsa procedure and then nonlinear response history analysis nlrha be carry out it be find that the rsa procedure provide good estimate for floor displacement and story drift ratio but significantly underestimate force demand when compare with nlrha the mrsahe method provide good estimate of shear force for the and story building and conservative estimate for the and story building while the mrsahi method provide good estimate for all case however mrsahi require a nonlinear inelastic structural model but mrsahe do not in both mrsa method the bend moment demand be compute in the same way as the conventional rsa procedure with ductile detailing in rc wall or column require at location where the combine axial and bend strain exceed a certain limit in order to determine the location that require ductile detailing in rc wall or column a novel method base on the equal displacement concept use strain from elastic analysis to predict inelastic strain be find to provide good agreement with inelastic strain compute from nlrha

The load forecast is one of the important tools for EMS. The short-term load forecasting (STLF) has a significant impact on efficient operation of EMS. Particularly, the accuracy of STLF can directly impact to EMS operating performance. This work applies the nonlinear feature selection called Mutual information (MI) method to select significant features of input to improve model performance of Artificial neural network (ANN) and Recurrent neural network (RNN). Then, we compare the STLF with Mae Hong Son data set using the ANN and RNN models. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and Mean absolute error (MAE) are used to determine STLF performance. To illustrate the effectiveness of the improved STFL models, we compare performance between models with MI method and models using stepwise regression method.","['PE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'MATH']",short term load forecast for energy management system use neural network with mutual information method of input selection the society of instrument and control engineer sice energy management system ems provide efficient planning and management of power balance the load forecast be one of the important tool for ems the short term load forecasting stlf have a significant impact on efficient operation of ems particularly the accuracy of stlf can directly impact to ems operating performance this work apply the nonlinear feature selection call mutual information mi method to select significant feature of input to improve model performance of artificial neural network ann and recurrent neural network rnn then we compare the stlf with mae hong son datum set use the ann and rnn model root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae be use to determine stlf performance to illustrate the effectiveness of the improve stfl model we compare performance between model with mi method and model use stepwise regression method
338,Structure and mechanical properties of ADC 12 Al foam-polymer interpenetrating phase composites with epoxy resin or silicone,"© Carl Hanser Verlag, München Materials Testing.Metal foam is a high-porosity engineering material which has many outstanding properties such as lightness, high specific strength and stiffness, large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation. Impregnation of metal foams with polymers produces new types of composites such as interpenetrating phase composites (IPCs) and co-continuous composites, due to an interconnection on the macroscopic level of individual phases as a co-continuous 3-D network. The coexistence of the metal and polymer phases allows each to contribute its prominent properties to the composite. This novel composite material is a potential candidate for applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The present study aims to develop two IPCs from open-cell Al foams of 20 ppi impregnated with silicone or epoxy resin. The compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristics of IPCs are also examined and compared. The results showed that although both IPCs have a similar foam structure with similar density, the disparities in the properties of impregnated polymers lead to distinct mechanical properties. The combination of the Al foam and polymers, both silicone and epoxy resin, yield stiffer IPCs than either of the two individual materials alone. Higher stiffness was found in IPCs with epoxy resin, owing to the brittle nature of the resin. Energy absorption capacity was also increased when compared with the original Al foam.","['METAL', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",structure and mechanical property of adc al foam polymer interpenetrate phase composite with epoxy resin or silicone carl hanser verlag münchen material testing metal foam be a high porosity engineering material which have many outstanding property such as lightness high specific strength and stiffness large energy absorption during impact and good thermal transportation impregnation of metal foam with polymer produce new type of composite such as interpenetrating phase composite ipc and co continuous composite due to an interconnection on the macroscopic level of individual phase as a co continuous d network the coexistence of the metal and polymer phase allow each to contribute its prominent property to the composite this novel composite material be a potential candidate for application in the automotive and aerospace industry the present study aim to develop two ipc from open cell al foams of ppi impregnate with silicone or epoxy resin the compressive behavior and energy absorption characteristic of ipc be also examine and compare the result show that although both ipc have a similar foam structure with similar density the disparity in the property of impregnated polymer lead to distinct mechanical property the combination of the al foam and polymer both silicone and epoxy resin yield stiff ipc than either of the two individual material alone high stiffness be find in ipc with epoxy resin owe to the brittle nature of the resin energy absorption capacity be also increase when compare with the original al foam

340,Effect of chromium content on heat treatment behavior of multi-alloyed white cast iron for abrasive wear resistance,"©2019 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials. The effect of chromium (Cr) content on heat treatment behavior of multi-alloyed white cast iron with basic alloy composition of 5 mass% Mo, W and V each and 2 mass%C was investigated. Cast iron with varying Cr content from 3 to 9% was prepared. Specimens were annealed at 1223 K and then hardened using fan air cooling from 1323 and 1373 K austenitizing. Hardened specimens were tempered between 673 and 873 K with 50 K intervals. In the as-cast state, the microstructure of specimens with Cr content less than 5 mass% consisted of primary austenite and eutectic structure of (£ +MC) along with (£ +M 2 C). The (£ +M 7 C 3 ) was observed in specimens with Cr content of more than 5 mass%. In as-hardened state, the hardness increased to the highest value at 5 mass%Cr and subsequently decreased with an increase in the Cr content. The volume fraction of retained austenite (V£) also behaved in the same way with reference to hardness. In the tempered state, evident secondary hardening was observed in all specimens. Maximum tempered hardness (H Tmax ) was obtained at 773798 K tempering. The V£ values decreased continuously as the tempering temperature increased and they were overall less than 5% at H Tmax . The degree of secondary hardening (¦Hs) increased proportionally with a rise of V£ in as-hardened state. The H Tmax increased first and then decreased as the Cr content increased. The highest values of H Tmax were obtained in 5 mass%Cr specimen regardless of austenitizing temperature.","['METAL', 'ME', 'MATSCI']",effect of chromium content on heat treatment behavior of multi alloy white cast iron for abrasive wear resistance the japan institute of metal and material the effect of chromium cr content on heat treatment behavior of multi alloy white cast iron with basic alloy composition of mass mo w and v each and mass c be investigate cast iron with vary cr content from to be prepared specimen be anneal at k and then harden use fan air cool from and k austenitize harden specimen be temper between and k with k interval in the as cast state the microstructure of specimen with cr content less than mass consist of primary austenite and eutectic structure of mc along with m c the m c be observe in specimen with cr content of more than mass in as harden state the hardness increase to the high value at mass cr and subsequently decrease with an increase in the cr content the volume fraction of retain austenite v also behave in the same way with reference to hardness in the temper state evident secondary hardening be observe in all specimen maximum temper hardness h tmax be obtain at k temper the v value decrease continuously as the temper temperature increase and they be overall less than at h tmax the degree of secondary hardening hs increase proportionally with a rise of v in as harden state the h tmax increase first and then decrease as the cr content increase the high value of h tmax be obtain in mass cr speciman regardless of austenitize temperature

Required model parameters: adsorption isotherm, overall mass transfer and axial dispersion coefficients, were first determined. The adsorption isotherms of the compounds were studied using batch adsorption experiments, while the axial dispersion and overall mass transfer coefficients were determined from published empirical-correlation and correlation developed experimentally from this study, respectively. The adsorption isotherms were found to be linear within the equilibrium concentration of ≤100 μg/ml. The isotherm constants of fatty acids were about twice those of free lutein. The isotherm constants and the mass transport parameters were then applied to the mass transfer model. The predicted results were compared with the experimental data at the optimum mobile phase velocity (0.16 cm/s). Good agreement was found, i.e., the average absolute deviations were less than 2% and 7% for semi-preparative and preparative columns, respectively.","['ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",development of mass transfer model for chromatographic separation of free lutein and fatty acid in de esterified marigold lutein institution of chemical engineersthis article be aim to construct a mathematical mass transfer model for chromatographic separation of free lutein and fatty acid in de esterified marigold lutein require model parameter adsorption isotherm overall mass transfer and axial dispersion coefficient be first determine the adsorption isotherm of the compound be study use batch adsorption experiment while the axial dispersion and overall mass transfer coefficient be determine from publish empirical correlation and correlation develop experimentally from this study respectively the adsorption isotherm be find to be linear within the equilibrium concentration of μg ml the isotherm constant of fatty acid be about twice those of free lutein the isotherm constant and the mass transport parameter be then apply to the mass transfer model the predict result be compare with the experimental datum at the optimum mobile phase velocity cm s good agreement be find I e the average absolute deviation be less than and for semi preparative and preparative column respectively

344,A Comparative Study on Various Deep Learning Techniques for Thai NLP Lexical and Syntactic Tasks on Noisy Data,"© 2018 IEEE.In Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are three fundamental tasks of NLP which are Tokenization being a part of a lexical level, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS) and Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) being parts of a syntactic level. Recently, there have been many deep learning researches showing their success in many domains. However, there has been no comparative study for Thai NLP to suggest the most suitable technique for each task yet. In this paper, we aim to provide a performance comparison among various deep learning-based techniques on three NLP tasks, and study the effect on synthesized OOV words and the OOV handling algorithm with Levenshtein distance had been provided due to the fact that most existing works relied on a set of vocabularies in the trained model and not being fit for noisy text in the real use case. Our three experiments were conducted on BEST 2010 I2R, a standard Thai NLP corpus on F1 measurement, with the different percentage of noises having been synthesized. Firstly, for Tokenization, the result shows that Synthai, a jointed bidirectional LSTM, has the best performance. Additionally, for POS, bi-directional LSTM with CRF has obtained the best performance. For NER, variational bi-directional LSTM with CRF has outperformed other methods. Finally, the effect of noises reduces the performance of all algorithms on these foundation tasks and the result shows that our OOV handling technique could improve the performance on noisy data.",['CPE'],a comparative study on various deep learn technique for thai nlp lexical and syntactic task on noisy datum ieee in natural language processing nlp there be three fundamental task of nlp which be tokenization be a part of a lexical level part of speech tag pos and name entity recognition ner be part of a syntactic level recently there have be many deep learning research show their success in many domain however there have be no comparative study for thai nlp to suggest the most suitable technique for each task yet in this paper we aim to provide a performance comparison among various deep learning base technique on three nlp task and study the effect on synthesized oov word and the oov handle algorithm with levenshtein distance have be provide due to the fact that most existing work rely on a set of vocabulary in the train model and not be fit for noisy text in the real use case our three experiment be conduct on good I r a standard thai nlp corpus on f measurement with the different percentage of noise having be synthesize firstly for tokenization the result show that synthai a jointed bidirectional lstm have the good performance additionally for pos bi directional lstm with crf have obtain the good performance for ner variational bi directional lstm with crf have outperform other method finally the effect of noise reduce the performance of all algorithm on these foundation task and the result show that our oov handling technique could improve the performance on noisy datum
345,A Comparative Study of the Divalent Transition Metal Oxide Supported on Magnesium Oxide Catalyst for Lactic Acid Production from Glucose,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In order to achieve the lactic acid production of lower energy consumption, reactor corrosion rate, while being environmentally friendly and sustaining high catalytic activity of various divalent transition metal oxide (Cu, Co, Ni and Zn) supported on magnesium oxide having the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a capping agent was investigated, where the reaction was performed under mild conditions in an alkali additive-free environment. Among all of the divalent candidates, the ZnCTAB/MgO exhibits the highest activity with a glucose conversion of 64% at a 100°C and a lactic acid yield of 12% at 140°C, a pressure of 0.4 MPa, over 1 h of reaction time. This is due to the high basicity produced via the water chemisorption on such catalyst's surface.","['PE', 'METAL', 'CHE']",a comparative study of the divalent transition metal oxide support on magnesium oxide catalyst for lactic acid production from glucose publish under licence by iop publish ltd in order to achieve the lactic acid production of low energy consumption reactor corrosion rate while be environmentally friendly and sustain high catalytic activity of various divalent transition metal oxide cu co ni and zn support on magnesium oxide have the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab as a cap agent be investigate where the reaction be perform under mild condition in an alkali additive free environment among all of the divalent candidate the znctab mgo exhibit the high activity with a glucose conversion of at a c and a lactic acid yield of at c a pressure of mpa over h of reaction time this be due to the high basicity produce via the water chemisorption on such catalyst s surface

347,Corrosion behavior of Ti-Cr-N coatings on tool steel substrates prepared using DC magnetron sputtering at low growth temperatures,"© 2018In this research, Ti-Cr-N coatings on tool steel were prepared using DC magnetron sputtering at 25 °C (RT), 130 °C and 190 °C. Coating corrosion behavior was observed in a 3.5% NaCl solution at 25 °C using Potentiodynamic Polarization and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). EIS circuit models for corrosion kinetics were proposed and the surface area and porosity of the coatings were recorded. Corrosion resistance was found to be higher for the coatings grown at 190 °C. This could be attributed to high density as well as low porosity. The EIS circuit model suggests the penetration of corrosive electrolytes into pores reaching the steel substrate for the coatings grown at RT. Finite length diffusion inside pores was also observed. The slow infiltration of corrosive electrolytes into the steel substrate could be seen in coatings grown at 130 °C with diffusion inside the pore similar to that in the coatings grown at RT. However, the EIS circuit model did not exhibit a finite length diffusion of the coatings grown at 190 °C. Owing to high coating density and smaller pore size, corrosive electrolytes could hardly penetrate through and reach the steel substrate.","['METAL', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'MATSCI']",corrosion behavior of ti cr n coating on tool steel substrate prepare use dc magnetron sputter at low growth temperature in this research ti cr n coating on tool steel be prepare use dc magnetron sputter at c rt c and c coating corrosion behavior be observe in a nacl solution at c use potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis eis circuit model for corrosion kinetic be propose and the surface area and porosity of the coating be record corrosion resistance be find to be high for the coating grow at c this could be attribute to high density as well as low porosity the eis circuit model suggest the penetration of corrosive electrolyte into pore reach the steel substrate for the coating grow at rt finite length diffusion inside pore be also observe the slow infiltration of corrosive electrolyte into the steel substrate could be see in coating grow at c with diffusion inside the pore similar to that in the coating grow at rt however the eis circuit model do not exhibit a finite length diffusion of the coating grow at c owe to high coating density and small pore size corrosive electrolyte could hardly penetrate through and reach the steel substrate
348,Application of computational fluid dynamics and response surface methodology in downdraft gasification using multiple biomass pellets,"© 2023 Elsevier LtdDowndraft gasifier is a promising technology converting biomass into synthesis gas (syngas) for decentralized heat and power generation. As biomass is seasonal variation and diversity, the design of the gasifier should consider a variety of biomass feedstock. This study investigated a single-designed downdraft gasifier of different biomass pellets using computational fluid dynamics and optimized for producer gas quality and gasifier efficiencies. Three biomass pellets, i.e., wood, bagasse, and palm-oil empty fruit bunch (PEFB), were considered the primary qualitative variable in addition to the main process variables, i.e., air-inlet temperature and equivalence ratio (ER). Response surface methodology (RSM) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) were carried out for process and biomass optimization. Tar yield is considered a response for optimization along with carbon conversion (CCE) and cold gas efficiencies (CGE). The results showed that ER and biomass type are crucial. The range of ER for each biomass should be carefully selected. The maximum efficiencies of the gasifier can be achieved using PEFB pellets, whereas the minimum tar yield was attained using wood pellets. The CCE and CGE of 93.11% and 65.16%, respectively, and the tar yield of 12.36 mg Nm−3, were obtained at an optimum ER of 0.28 and air-inlet temperature of 1272.8 K using PEFB pellets.","['PE', 'CPE', 'CHE', 'AGRI', 'IE', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",application of computational fluid dynamic and response surface methodology in downdraft gasification use multiple biomass pellet elsevi ltddowndraft gasifi be a promising technology convert biomass into synthesis gas syngas for decentralized heat and power generation as biomass be seasonal variation and diversity the design of the gasifi should consider a variety of biomass feedstock this study investigate a single design downdraft gasifi of different biomass pellet use computational fluid dynamic and optimize for producer gas quality and gasifi efficiency three biomass pellet I e wood bagasse and palm oil empty fruit bunch pefb be consider the primary qualitative variable in addition to the main process variable I e air inlet temperature and equivalence ratio er response surface methodology rsm and multi objective genetic algorithm moga be carry out for process and biomass optimization tar yield be consider a response for optimization along with carbon conversion cce and cold gas efficiency cge the result show that er and biomass type be crucial the range of er for each biomass should be carefully select the maximum efficiency of the gasifi can be achieve use pefb pellet whereas the minimum tar yield be attain use wood pellet the cce and cge of and respectively and the tar yield of mg nm be obtain at an optimum er of and air inlet temperature of k use pefb pellet
349,Portioning Algorithm Using the Bisection Method for Slicing Food,"© 2023 IEEE.Food is an essential part of human life and plays a crucial role in maintaining good health and well-being. In various industries, such as food processing and packaging, it is essential to ensure that raw materials are divided equally to optimize the production process and reduce waste. However, traditional methods of food processing and packaging can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, we are interested in developing a method for accurately portion materials into equal sizes using the Intel RealSense D435i 3D camera to capture point cloud images of object, which are then processed using Python code, running on a Raspberry Pi 4, to generate cutting planes. In the experiment on object size variations, three sizes of plasticine weighing 50 g, 150 g, and 250 g. resulting in errors of 10.2%, 8.8%, and 7.3%, respectively. In the experiment on the number of cutting plane variations, keeping the object weight fixed at 150 g at 150 g, and divided into 2, 3, 4, and 5 pieces. The resulting errors were 1.3%, 8.8%, 10.7%, and 18.2%, respectively, according to the number of pieces. Our algorithm can generate precise cutting planes to partition the volume of an object. The primary cause of errors is the shape resolution of the object's point cloud that the camera can collect and the use of human hands for cutting the object.","['CPE', 'OPTIC', 'AGRI']",portion algorithm use the bisection method for slice food ieee food be an essential part of human life and play a crucial role in maintain good health and well be in various industry such as food processing and packaging it be essential to ensure that raw material be divide equally to optimize the production process and reduce waste however traditional method of food processing and packaging can be time consume and prone to error hence we be interested in develop a method for accurately portion material into equal size use the intel realsense d I d camera to capture point cloud image of object which be then process use python code run on a raspberry pi to generate cut plane in the experiment on object size variation three size of plasticine weigh g g and g result in error of and respectively in the experiment on the number of cut plane variation keep the object weight fix at g at g and divide into and piece the result error be and respectively accord to the number of piece our algorithm can generate precise cut plane to partition the volume of an object the primary cause of error be the shape resolution of the object s point cloud that the camera can collect and the use of human hand for cut the object

Recently, the case study company has produced components with a high defect rate, which increased sharply to 22.3% in June 2018. The major causes of the defect resulting from PET film peeled off. In order to reduce the defect rate, the five steps of the DMAIC Six Sigma methodology are implemented. The detail of the IMD manufacturing process was studied to identify appropriate measurement methods and factors affecting PET film peeled off by using the cause and effect diagram and its scoring matrix. Then the prioritized factors were analyzed and selected from FMEA to conduct the design of experiment (DOE) to find significant factors and optimal parameter settings for improvement and control process to prevent reoccurrence. After improvement of PET film peeled off by setting appropriate parameter as well as implementing control plans and Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) to eliminate other defects from in-mould decoration process, the result shows that the defect rate of in-mould decoration process decreased from 22.3% to 0.7% in July 2018.","['OPTIC', 'MATENG', 'EDU', 'IE', 'MATSCI']",defect reduction in the manufacturing process of in mould decoration of injection mould component trans tech publications ltd switzerland the purpose of this research be to reduce the defect rate from the manufacturing process of in mould decoration imd the process combine pet film with decorative pattern be mould together with abs resin which have be develop to reduce the secondary process of decorative screen printing recently the case study company have produce component with a high defect rate which increase sharply to in june the major cause of the defect result from pet film peel off in order to reduce the defect rate the five step of the dmaic six sigma methodology be implement the detail of the imd manufacturing process be study to identify appropriate measurement method and factor affect pet film peel off by use the cause and effect diagram and its scoring matrix then the prioritize factor be analyze and select from fmea to conduct the design of experiment doe to find significant factor and optimal parameter setting for improvement and control process to prevent reoccurrence after improvement of pet film peel off by set appropriate parameter as well as implement control plan and standard operation procedure sop to eliminate other defect from in mould decoration process the result show that the defect rate of in mould decoration process decrease from to in july
351,Occluded Facial Recognition with 2DPCA based Convolutional Neural Network,"© 2019 IEEE.Face occlusions with glasses or scarf are quite common in the real-world scenes, or more seriously, terrorists often cover their faces with sunglasses or a mask to hide themselves from the cameras. Occluded facial recognition is, therefore, an important problem in surveillance defense department. A system that can recognize faces with occlusions may need to be trained by a huge set of facial databases. To reduce the complexity of an occluded facial recognition system, this paper investigates the effects of the two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) in the initialization phase on image classification by the convolutional neural network (CNN). Our experiments show that 2DPCA can reduce the image dimension for training while keeping the accuracy rate comparing to using the whole images. Our results, at 0.001 learning rate, showed 81.91% accuracy with 120 eigenvectors for the AR database, and 99.95 % accuracy rate with 190 eigenvectors for the GTAV database.","['EE', 'CPE', 'MATH']",occlude facial recognition with dpca base convolutional neural network ieee face occlusion with glass or scarf be quite common in the real world scene or more seriously terrorist often cover their face with sunglass or a mask to hide themselves from the camera occlude facial recognition be therefore an important problem in surveillance defense department a system that can recognize face with occlusion may need to be train by a huge set of facial database to reduce the complexity of an occlude facial recognition system this paper investigate the effect of the two dimensional principal component analysis dpca in the initialization phase on image classification by the convolutional neural network cnn our experiment show that dpca can reduce the image dimension for training while keep the accuracy rate compare to use the whole image our result at learn rate show accuracy with eigenvector for the ar database and accuracy rate with eigenvector for the gtav database
352,Flexible Printed Active Antenna for Digital Television Reception,"© 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).This paper presents the development of a flexible printed active antenna for the digital television (DTV) reception in areas having poor signal or in high-rise buildings. The antenna structure is composed of a meander line printed on a polyimide film as a radiating element. It has a thickness of 0.3 mm, highly flexible, and very lightweight. The design and analysis of the radiating element are based on a full-wave method implemented by a commercial electromagnetic simulation software. The amplifier circuit consisting of a surface-mount transistor and passive components are integrated directly on the polyimide film, residing next to the feedline, to improve the antenna performance and minimize the whole antenna dimension. The impedance matching between the radiating element, the feed line, and the active circuit are considered. The measured results show that the return loss of more than approximately 10 dB, the maximum gain of about 18 dB, and the Omni-directional radiation pattern are achieved in the operating frequency band of 510-790 MHz. Due to its flexibility, low profile, lightweight, and additional gain, the proposed antenna could be useful for various specific applications.","['CE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'MATENG']",flexible print active antenna for digital television reception the institute of electronics information and communication engineer ieice this paper present the development of a flexible print active antenna for the digital television dtv reception in area have poor signal or in high rise building the antenna structure be compose of a meand line print on a polyimide film as a radiate element it have a thickness of mm highly flexible and very lightweight the design and analysis of the radiating element be base on a full wave method implement by a commercial electromagnetic simulation software the amplifi circuit consist of a surface mount transistor and passive component be integrate directly on the polyimide film reside next to the feedline to improve the antenna performance and minimize the whole antenna dimension the impedance match between the radiate element the feed line and the active circuit be consider the measured result show that the return loss of more than approximately db the maximum gain of about db and the omni directional radiation pattern be achieve in the operate frequency band of mhz due to its flexibility low profile lightweight and additional gain the propose antenna could be useful for various specific application
353,Unit Management of a BESS-Integrated Hydro Power Plant for Spinning Reserve Enhancement,"© 2021 IEEE.Owing to its fast response, the hydro power plant is normally assigned to provide spinning reserve for the power system. Despite of its large capacity, minimum generation constraint and lack of management of multi-unit generations result in limited spinning reserve. This paper solves this problem by integrating a battery energy storage system with the hydro power plant and proposes a unit management algorithm to cooperatively manage the multi-unit generation. As a result, the hydro power plant can virtually provide any demanded generation, and its spinning reserve is increased significantly compared to the traditional operation. A case study on Rajjaprabha hydro power plant in Thailand is conducted to confirm feasibility of the proposed concept.","['PE', 'ME', 'MATENG']",unit management of a bess integrate hydro power plant for spin reserve enhancement ieee owe to its fast response the hydro power plant be normally assign to provide spinning reserve for the power system despite of its large capacity minimum generation constraint and lack of management of multi unit generation result in limited spinning reserve this paper solve this problem by integrate a battery energy storage system with the hydro power plant and propose a unit management algorithm to cooperatively manage the multi unit generation as a result the hydro power plant can virtually provide any demand generation and its spinning reserve be increase significantly compare to the traditional operation a case study on rajjaprabha hydro power plant in thailand be conduct to confirm feasibility of the propose concept
354,Designing number of Kanban in glove box assembly,"© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.For many decades, Just-In-Time manufacturing and lean manufacturing have adopted kanban system as a mean to control inventory and production. A number of tagged kanban cards represents inventory of the system, whereas untagged kanban cards equate to production orders. The ideal conditions are a consistent product mixed with a small production lot size and minimum setup time. Such conditions are difficult to obtain even in many automotive assembly lines similar to a case study. The case study assembly line is a glove box assembly production line that assembles two plastic parts and wields them together with a vibration machine after positioning in a mold designed for different products. Because of storage equipment, each kanban card represents 60 identical glove boxes. Therefore, a production engineer re-schedules the production planning to minimize the numbers of changeover without any effect on downstream. This ad hoc production scheduling leads to urgent production orders and interruption of lot size. As a result, the factory embeds historical data into a computer simulation that accounts for current molds, receiving time, and numbers of pending kanban cards, as well as number of storage equipment. The results of this simulation reveals that scheduling criteria and suggest a suitable lot size if the factory decides to change a storage equipment.","['METAL', 'ME', 'CPE', 'MATENG', 'IE']",design number of kanban in glove box assembly the author publish by edp science for many decade just in time manufacturing and lean manufacturing have adopt kanban system as a mean to control inventory and production a number of tag kanban card represent inventory of the system whereas untagged kanban card equate to production order the ideal condition be a consistent product mix with a small production lot size and minimum setup time such condition be difficult to obtain even in many automotive assembly line similar to a case study the case study assembly line be a glove box assembly production line that assemble two plastic part and wield they together with a vibration machine after position in a mold design for different product because of storage equipment each kanban card represent identical glove box therefore a production engineer re schedule the production planning to minimize the number of changeover without any effect on downstream this ad hoc production scheduling lead to urgent production order and interruption of lot size as a result the factory embed historical datum into a computer simulation that account for current mold receive time and number of pende kanban card as well as number of storage equipment the result of this simulation reveal that scheduling criterion and suggest a suitable lot size if the factory decide to change a storage equipment
355,Comparison of EEG measurement of upper limb movement in motor imagery training system,"© 2018 The Author(s).Background: One of the most promising applications for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface is for stroke rehabilitation. Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Methods: Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. Conclusion: High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment.","['BME', 'CPE', 'MATH']",comparison of eeg measurement of upper limb movement in motor imagery training system the author s background one of the most promising application for electroencephalogram eeg base brain computer interface be for stroke rehabilitation implement as a standalone motor imagery mi training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system many study have show benefit of use they to restore motor control in stroke patient hand movement have widely be choose as mi task although potentially more challenging to analyze wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion extension and forearm pronation supination should also be consider for mi task because these movement be part of the main exercise give to patient in conventional stroke rehabilitation this paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movement for mi task method three hand and wrist movement task which be hand opening close wrist flexion extension and forearm pronation supination be choose as motor imagery task for both hand eleven subject participate in the experiment all of they complete hand opening closing task session ten subject complete two mi task session which be hand opening closing and wrist flexion extension five subject complete all three mi task session each mi task comprise session span a week period for classification feature extraction base on common spatial pattern csp algorithm be use two type be implement one with conventional csp term wb and one with an increase number of feature achieve by filter eeg datum into five band term fb classification be do by linear discriminant analysis lda and support vector machine svm result eight fold cross validation be apply on eeg datum lda and svm give comparable classification accuracy fb achieve significantly high classification accuracy compare to wb the accuracy of classify wrist flexion extension task be high than that of classify hand opening closing task in all subject classify forearm pronation supination task achieve high accuracy than classify hand opening closing task in most subject but achieve low accuracy than classify wrist flexion extension task in all subject significant improvement of classification accuracy be find in nine subject when consider individual session of experiment of all mi task the result of classify hand opening closing task and wrist flexion extension task be comparable to the result of classify hand opening closing task and forearm pronation supination task classification accuracy of wrist flexion extension task and forearm pronation supination task be low than those of hand movement task and wrist movement task conclusion high classification accuracy of the three mi task support the possibility of use eeg base stroke rehabilitation system with these movement either lda or svm can equally be choose as a classifier since the difference of their accuracy be not statistically significant significantly high classification accuracy make fb more suitable for classify mi task compare to wb more training session could potentially lead to well accuracy as evident in most subject in this experiment
356,Hydrogen activated WOx-supported catalysts for Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid observed by in situ DRIFTS of adsorbed ammonia: Effect of different supports on the Lewis acid transformation,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The effect of hydrogen introduction on Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid was investigated over the WOx catalysts supported on different supports (HY-15, HY-500, MCM-22, SiO2, and Al2O3). The Lewis acid transformation on the catalysts was investigated by in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed NH3 at 100 °C under atmospheric pressure for 130 min. According to the results of in situ DRIFTS, ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred over the WOx catalysts supported on all different supports. It is proposed that the partial reduction of WOx occurred under the hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The generated oxygen vacancies of the supported WOx catalysts were found to play an important role for activating the hydrogen spillover, leading to Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid. It was suggested that the selected support is the crucial factor for Lewis acid transformation performances. The results from our experiments showed that the weak interaction between WOx and support led to the easy reduction of W species, which promoted the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The large amount of oxygen vacancies leads to high Lewis acid transformation. Moreover, the influence of different supports was discussed and investigated by several analytical techniques such as H2-TPD, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, UV–vis, XRD, XPS, and TEM-EDS techniques.","['ENV', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",hydrogen activate wox support catalyst for lewis acid transformation to bronsted acid observe by in situ drift of adsorbed ammonia effect of different support on the lewis acid transformation elsevi b v the effect of hydrogen introduction on lewis acid transformation to bronsted acid be investigate over the wox catalyst support on different support hy hy mcm sio and al o the lewis acid transformation on the catalyst be investigate by in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrare fourier transform spectroscopy drift of adsorbed nh at c under atmospheric pressure for min accord to the result of in situ drift ammonia migration from lewis acid site to bronsted acid site occur over the wox catalyst support on all different support it be propose that the partial reduction of wox occur under the hydrogen atmosphere result in the generation of oxygen vacancy site the generate oxygen vacancy of the support wox catalyst be find to play an important role for activate the hydrogen spillover lead to lewis acid transformation to bronsted acid it be suggest that the select support be the crucial factor for lewis acid transformation performance the result from our experiment show that the weak interaction between wox and support lead to the easy reduction of w specie which promote the generation of oxygen vacancy site the large amount of oxygen vacancy lead to high lewis acid transformation moreover the influence of different support be discuss and investigate by several analytical technique such as h tpd h tpr o tpd uv vis xrd xps and tem ed technique
357,Warehouse Management Improvement for a Textile Manufacturer,"© 2019 IEEE.This research aims to improve an inefficient warehouse management of a textile manufacturer in Thailand who has been facing an unpredictable seasonable demand and operated under poor space utilization. A few hours of downtime often occurred in a day which directly impacted on the production and in turn led to the late weekly shipment. On average, in 2018, only 83% of the shipments were on time (the target is 95%). One of the main root cause was the lack of materials due to unorganized inventory management that caused longer time to find materials. In order to reduce the downtime and improve the space utilization of the warehouse, inventory management and warehouse management systems were reviewed and a number of solutions were introduced. Firstly, inventories were classified and slow-moving or unused items were removed from the warehouse. Secondly, ABC analysis was introduced for the active ones. The layout of the warehouse was re-designed and a new operations system was developed. The result shows that inactive items had occupied most of the warehouse space equivalent to 1,342 pallets which were put in the disposal list. Moreover, new material handling equipment was brought into the warehouse to facilitate its operations.","['MATENG', 'IE']",warehouse management improvement for a textile manufacturer ieee this research aim to improve an inefficient warehouse management of a textile manufacturer in thailand who have be face an unpredictable seasonable demand and operate under poor space utilization a few hour of downtime often occur in a day which directly impact on the production and in turn lead to the late weekly shipment on average in only of the shipment be on time the target be one of the main root cause be the lack of material due to unorganized inventory management that cause long time to find material in order to reduce the downtime and improve the space utilization of the warehouse inventory management and warehouse management system be review and a number of solution be introduce firstly inventory be classified and slow move or unused item be remove from the warehouse secondly abc analysis be introduce for the active one the layout of the warehouse be re design and a new operation system be develop the result show that inactive item have occupy most of the warehouse space equivalent to pallet which be put in the disposal list moreover new material handling equipment be bring into the warehouse to facilitate its operation
358,Design and Development of an Assistive Hand Device for Enhancing Compatibility and Comfortability,"© 2018 IEEE.Currently, there are plenty of hand exoskeletons for rehabilitation and assistive purpose that have been developed. They have been designed for working with patient's limbs and can be used for hand positioning and executing task which help reduce therapist's workload and give them an alternative way to rehabilitate patients. However, there are some patients with permanent impairments, which cannot improve from rehabilitation. Thus, portable assistive devices could greatly help them performing simple activities of daily living (ADL), but such device has not been fully explored, the present design of tendon routing cannot closely replicate finger orientation and motion during grasping.

359,Microencapsulation of n-octadecane and methyl palmitate phase change materials in silica by spray drying process,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.The encapsulation of phase change materials (PCM) is the essential step to make PCM easily utilizable. Aiming for a feasible process on a large scale, the combination of PCM/sol-gel emulsion and the spray-dry process was employed for the production of PCM encapsulated in silica shell matrices. Two PCMs, methyl palmitate and n-octadecane, with operating temperature appropriated for thermal comfort in trocical countries were selected. The composition of emulsion, i.e. tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and n-octadecane or methyl palmitate, was varied to find the optimal conditions for encapsulation. The influence of composition and process time on PCM's emulsion stability, size and structure of microcapsules, and encapsulation efficiency were investigated. The results showed that the optimal PCM to silica ratio was determined by the maximum quantity that could maintain the rigidity of the microcapsule structure. The low surfactant concentration that could still sustain emulsion stability contributed to improved encapsulation efficiency.","['CE', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'IE', 'MATSCI']",microencapsulation of n octadecane and methyl palmitate phase change material in silica by spray dry process elsevi b v the encapsulation of phase change material pcm be the essential step to make pcm easily utilizable aim for a feasible process on a large scale the combination of pcm sol gel emulsion and the spray dry process be employ for the production of pcm encapsulate in silica shell matrice two pcms methyl palmitate and n octadecane with operate temperature appropriate for thermal comfort in trocical country be select the composition of emulsion I e tetraethyl orthosilicate teos cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab and n octadecane or methyl palmitate be varied to find the optimal condition for encapsulation the influence of composition and process time on pcm s emulsion stability size and structure of microcapsule and encapsulation efficiency be investigate the result show that the optimal pcm to silica ratio be determine by the maximum quantity that could maintain the rigidity of the microcapsule structure the low surfactant concentration that could still sustain emulsion stability contribute to improve encapsulation efficiency
360,Impact Analysis of Test Cases for Changing Inputs or Outputs of Functional Requirements,"© 2019 IEEE.In the software development process, requirement gathering process is very important because if the requirement elicitation is incomplete, it will result in changes of requirements. When changes occur, it may impact functional requirements and thus the changes should be controlled. Each function appeared in functional requirement consists of function name, description of function, inputs and outputs specification, and error messages of the function. Inputs and outputs specification of each function can be specified in terms of input and output names, input and output data types, as well as input and output constraints. Inputs and outputs of each function may be related and not related to database schema. Thus, when changes of inputs or outputs of a function that are related to database schema are occurred, the database schema and test cases of the function will be affected. This paper proposes an approach to analyze impact to test cases for changing inputs or outputs of functional requirements. Our approach offers change process to control changes over functional requirements, test cases, and database schema. The approach also enables rollback facility that allows cancelling of changes.","['CPE', 'EDU']",impact analysis of test case for change input or output of functional requirement ieee in the software development process requirement gathering process be very important because if the requirement elicitation be incomplete it will result in change of requirement when change occur it may impact functional requirement and thus the change should be control each function appear in functional requirement consist of function name description of function input and output specification and error message of the function input and output specification of each function can be specify in term of input and output name input and output datum type as well as input and output constraint input and output of each function may be relate and not relate to database schema thus when change of input or output of a function that be relate to database schema be occur the database schema and test case of the function will be affect this paper propose an approach to analyze impact to test case for change input or output of functional requirement our approach offer change process to control change over functional requirement test case and database schema the approach also enable rollback facility that allow cancel of change

362,Real Estate Recommendation Approach for Solving the Item Cold-Start Problem,"© 2013 IEEE.The item cold-start problem occurs when a recommendation system cannot recommend new items owing to record deficiencies and new listing omissions. When searching for real estate, users can register a concurrent interest in recent and prior projects. Thus, an approach to recommend cold-start and warm-start items simultaneously must be determined. Furthermore, unrequired membership and stop-by behavior cause real estate recommendations to have many cold-start and new users. This characteristic encourages the use of a content-based approach and a session-based recommendation system. Herein, we propose a real estate recommendation approach for solving the item cold-start problem with acceptable warm-start item recommendations in the many-cold-start-users scenario. We modify a session-based recommendation system and employ existing mechanisms to efficiently deal with sequential and context information for the next-interacted item's encoded attribute prediction. Subsequently, we use the nearest-neighbors approach using weighted cosine similarity to determine conforming candidates. We use Recall@K and MRR@K with the top-n recommendation to evaluate warm-start and cold-start item recommendations among different applied mechanisms and against the baselines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of efficiently integrating the information and the difficulty in performing well in warm-start and cold-start item recommendations simultaneously. Our proposed approach illustrates the capability of solving the item cold-start problem while yielding promising results in both recommendations although neither result is the best. We believe that our approach provides a suitable compromise between both recommendations and that it will benefit recommendation tasks focusing on both recommendations.",['CPE'],real estate recommendation approach for solve the item cold start problem ieee the item cold start problem occur when a recommendation system can not recommend new item owe to record deficiency and new listing omission when search for real estate user can register a concurrent interest in recent and prior project thus an approach to recommend cold start and warm start item simultaneously must be determine furthermore unrequired membership and stop by behavior cause real estate recommendation to have many cold start and new user this characteristic encourage the use of a content base approach and a session base recommendation system herein we propose a real estate recommendation approach for solve the item cold start problem with acceptable warm start item recommendation in the many cold start user scenario we modify a session base recommendation system and employ exist mechanism to efficiently deal with sequential and context information for the next interacted item s encode attribute prediction subsequently we use the near neighbor approach use weight cosine similarity to determine conform candidate we use recall k and mrr k with the top n recommendation to evaluate warm start and cold start item recommendation among different applied mechanism and against the baseline the result demonstrate the effectiveness of efficiently integrate the information and the difficulty in perform well in warm start and cold start item recommendation simultaneously our propose approach illustrate the capability of solve the item cold start problem while yield promising result in both recommendation although neither result be the good we believe that our approach provide a suitable compromise between both recommendation and that it will benefit recommendation task focus on both recommendation
363,Optimal hybrid renewable energy system considering maximum profit from electricity sale,"© 2019 IEEE.This paper proposes a method to determine the proportion of different renewable energy systems which are combined to be a hybrid renewable energy system. In addition, the daily operation of each renewable energy system can be determined. The results are aimed to be an optimal hybrid renewable energy system which provides the maximum profit from electricity sale throughout the project lifetime. Since the capacity and operation characteristics of renewable energy systems depend on their limited renewable energy resources in the vicinity of project locations and the characteristic of generators, the analysis considers the constraints along with investment cost, fuel cost, operation and management cost and financial parameters such as inflation rate, discount rate and interest. Furthermore, this paper considers various renewable energy sources consisting of solar, wind, biomass, biogas and RDF which are combinable to be thirteen combinations of hybrid renewable energy systems.

364,Inhibition effect of Na+ form in ZSM-5 zeolite on hydrogen transfer reaction via 1-butene cracking,"© 2019The Na+ and H+ of ZSM-5 having three Si/Al molar ratios (20, 35, and 50) were synthesized to investigate and illustrate 1-butene cracking mechanism. The physical and chemical properties of ZSM-5 were described by XRD, SEM-EDX, N2 physicsorption, FT-IR, pyridine-IR, 1H MAS NMR, TPO, and NH3-TPD techniques. For the characterization, the Na-ZSM-5 consisted of two main types of acid sites (weak and medium acid sites), whereas strong, medium, and weak acid sites were detected on H-ZSM-5. For H-ZSM-5, the Si-(OH)-Al site (strong Brønsted site) was an active site for 1-butene cracking reaction, while the active site of Na-ZSM-5 in the reaction was silanol nest (moderate Brønsted site). The 1-butene cracking reaction on H-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-5 was studied under the operating condition of temperature =500 °C, pressure =1 atm, and WHSV =3 h−1. The oligomerization, cracking, and hydrogen transfer were three main reactions in the 1-butene cracking mechanism. The alkenes excluding propylene occurred on weak acid site, while the formation of propylene underwent on medium acid site of ZSM-5 catalyst. The presence of strong acid site on ZSM-5 catalyst promoted the hydrogen transfer reaction, which provoked the alkane formation. The hydrogen transfer index in 1-butene reaction of Na-ZSM-5 was less than H-ZSM-5 in all Si/Al molar ratios because of the absence of strong acid. The Na-ZSM-5 (Si/Al molar ratio = 20) reached the highest propylene selectivity at 31.73 C-wt.% and the Na+ ion could block the strong acid site. At low Si/Al molar ratio, the stability of Na-ZSM-5 was higher than H-ZSM-5 because of the lower coke formation. Therefore, the Na-ZSM-5 was more suitable catalyst than H-ZSM-5 for propylene formation in 1-butene cracking reaction.","['METAL', 'CHE']",inhibition effect of na form in zsm zeolite on hydrogen transfer reaction via butene crack the na and h of zsm have three si al molar ratio and be synthesize to investigate and illustrate butene cracking mechanism the physical and chemical property of zsm be describe by xrd sem edx n physicsorption ft ir pyridine ir h mas nmr tpo and nh tpd technique for the characterization the na zsm consist of two main type of acid site weak and medium acid site whereas strong medium and weak acid site be detect on h zsm for h zsm the si oh al site strong brønste site be an active site for butene cracking reaction while the active site of na zsm in the reaction be silanol nest moderate brønste site the butene cracking reaction on h zsm and na zsm be study under the operating condition of temperature c pressure atm and whsv h the oligomerization crack and hydrogen transfer be three main reaction in the butene cracking mechanism the alkene exclude propylene occur on weak acid site while the formation of propylene underwent on medium acid site of zsm catalyst the presence of strong acid site on zsm catalyst promote the hydrogen transfer reaction which provoke the alkane formation the hydrogen transfer index in butene reaction of na zsm be less than h zsm in all si al molar ratio because of the absence of strong acid the na zsm si al molar ratio reach the high propylene selectivity at c wt and the na ion could block the strong acid site at low si al molar ratio the stability of na zsm be high than h zsm because of the low coke formation therefore the na zsm be more suitable catalyst than h zsm for propylene formation in butene cracking reaction
365,Convex formulation for regularized estimation of structural equation models,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Path analysis is a model class of structural equation modeling (SEM), which it describes causal relations among measured variables in the form of a multiple linear regression. This paper presents two estimation formulations, one each for confirmatory and exploratory SEM, where a zero pattern of the estimated path matrix can explain a causality structure of the variables. The original nonlinear equality constraints of the model parameters were relaxed to an inequality, allowing the transformation of the original problem into a convex framework. A regularized estimation formulation was then proposed for exploratory SEM using an l1-type penalty of the path coefficient matrix. Under a condition on problem parameters, our optimal solution is low rank and provides a useful solution to the original problem. Proximal algorithms were applied to solve our convex programs in a large-scale setting. The performance of this approach was demonstrated in both simulated and real data sets, and in comparison with an existing method.

368,Absorption process with aqueous solution of 2-(methylamino) ethanol for carbon dioxide removal from gas stream,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In power generation and petroleum industries, carbon dioxide can cause operational problems such as corrosion, and heating-value reduction. However, it can be used in many industries like food industries and in petroleum to enhance the oil recovery for oil production. However, the amount of carbon dioxide or supply is not enough because the cost of carbon capture is high. The main sources of carbon dioxide come from power plants and natural gas processing. The technology is carbon capture and storage. Currently, the effective technology to remove carbon dioxide to the lower level is chemical absorption and chemicals used in this technology play an important role. Nowadays, the commercially used solvents are monoethanolamine. Nevertheless, it also has disadvantages such as low capacity, corrosion and high energy requirement for regeneration; thus, making this technology not economically viable. Therefore, many new solvents such as 2-(methylamino)ethanol have been developed to improve efficiency and to compensate the drawbacks of conventional solution for carbon dioxide capture. Consequently, the aim of this work is to measure the solubility data of carbon dioxide in a 5M aqueous solution of 2-(methylamino)ethanol as a solvent at the temperature from 30 °C to 80 °C and partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The solubility results of carbon dioxide in 2-(methylamino)ethanol solution are compared with that of the aqueous solution of monoethanolamine at the same conditions. In term of cyclic capacities, the results show that 2-(methylamino)ethanol provides higher performance which is up to 86.8% and 150.9% higher than that of monoethanolamine at 15 and 100 kPa, respectively. Furthermore, the results present that the loading can increase as partial pressure increases and decrease at higher temperature. This can result in the decrease in energy requirement for solution regeneration and liquid-circulation rate, leading to the reduction in the overall cost of carbon capture.","['ENV', 'PE', 'CPE', 'CHE']",absorption process with aqueous solution of methylamino ethanol for carbon dioxide removal from gas stream publish under licence by iop publish ltd in power generation and petroleum industry carbon dioxide can cause operational problem such as corrosion and heating value reduction however it can be use in many industry like food industry and in petroleum to enhance the oil recovery for oil production however the amount of carbon dioxide or supply be not enough because the cost of carbon capture be high the main source of carbon dioxide come from power plant and natural gas processing the technology be carbon capture and storage currently the effective technology to remove carbon dioxide to the low level be chemical absorption and chemical use in this technology play an important role nowadays the commercially use solvent be monoethanolamine nevertheless it also have disadvantage such as low capacity corrosion and high energy requirement for regeneration thus make this technology not economically viable therefore many new solvent such as methylamino ethanol have be develop to improve efficiency and to compensate the drawback of conventional solution for carbon dioxide capture consequently the aim of this work be to measure the solubility datum of carbon dioxide in a m aqueous solution of methylamino ethanol as a solvent at the temperature from c to c and partial pressure range from to kpa the solubility result of carbon dioxide in methylamino ethanol solution be compare with that of the aqueous solution of monoethanolamine at the same condition in term of cyclic capacity the result show that methylamino ethanol provide high performance which be up to and high than that of monoethanolamine at and kpa respectively furthermore the result present that the loading can increase as partial pressure increase and decrease at high temperature this can result in the decrease in energy requirement for solution regeneration and liquid circulation rate lead to the reduction in the overall cost of carbon capture
369,Parameter-controllable microchannel reactor for enhanced deposition of copper sulfide thin films,"© 2017 Elsevier B.V.A microchannel reactor was designed and fabricated based on the unique fluid-flow and mass transfer characteristics in a closely parallel channel for the deposition of copper sulfide (CuxS) thin films. The configuration of the microchannel allows the flow pattern to be confined uniformly across the channel width and length, thereby resulting in a uniform deposited thin film covering the whole surface of the substrate. A parametric study of the deposition of CuxS thin films was performed, including the effects of deposition time (2–10 min), flow rate (2–6 ml/min) and reaction temperature (60–80 °C). It was observed that the basic characteristics of CuxS films, such as morphology, film thickness, film composition and optical band gap, were highly affected by all deposition parameters. We were able to attain smooth, dense and adherent CuxS film with homogeneous grains at a high growth rate of 1.8 μm/h, by optimizing the controllable parameters. The optimized condition was at temperature of 80 °C, flow rate of 6 ml/min and deposition time of 4 min. The results showed that the film formation by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the substrate is promoted over homogeneous reaction in the solution phase, which is strongly due to the incorporation of the optimal channel design in a micro-scale structure together with the controlled deposition parameters. This method can overcome the issue of the deposition in limited area and can be scaled for large-area substrates with good uniformity of CuxS films.","['METAL', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",parameter controllable microchannel reactor for enhance deposition of copper sulfide thin film elsevi b v a microchannel reactor be design and fabricate base on the unique fluid flow and mass transfer characteristic in a closely parallel channel for the deposition of copper sulfide cux thin film the configuration of the microchannel allow the flow pattern to be confine uniformly across the channel width and length thereby result in a uniform deposit thin film cover the whole surface of the substrate a parametric study of the deposition of cuxs thin film be perform include the effect of deposition time min flow rate ml min and reaction temperature c it be observe that the basic characteristic of cuxs film such as morphology film thickness film composition and optical band gap be highly affect by all deposition parameter we be able to attain smooth dense and adherent cux film with homogeneous grain at a high growth rate of μm h by optimize the controllable parameter the optimize condition be at temperature of c flow rate of ml min and deposition time of min the result show that the film formation by heterogeneous nucleation and growth on the substrate be promote over homogeneous reaction in the solution phase which be strongly due to the incorporation of the optimal channel design in a micro scale structure together with the control deposition parameter this method can overcome the issue of the deposition in limited area and can be scale for large area substrate with good uniformity of cuxs film

A periodic-review base-stock policy with an echelon stock concept was applied at all locations. Seasonal demand with a short cycle was considered at the level of the retailers. A two-phase heuristic method was then proposed to reduce the computational time required to determine a proper policy compared to the mixed-integer programming models. The first-phase algorithm was used to determine the initial ordering policy for each location, while the second-phase algorithm was used to determine the safety stock. Both algorithms could find solutions that are as good as the solutions from the mixed-integer programming models in testing instances but they substantially reduced the computational time. The solutions were tested with other instances having a 10,000-period horizon, where the average loss was within the expected service level and the number of periods with an unsatisfied expected service level was less than 1% of the planning horizon.","['CPE', 'IE', 'MATH']",heuristic for a periodic review policy in a two echelon inventory problem with seasonal demand elsevier ltdthis paper propose heuristic method to determine an order policy with a minimum inventory cost while satisfy the expect service level constraint in a divergent two echelon inventory system a periodic review base stock policy with an echelon stock concept be apply at all location seasonal demand with a short cycle be consider at the level of the retailer a two phase heuristic method be then propose to reduce the computational time require to determine a proper policy compare to the mixed integer programming model the first phase algorithm be use to determine the initial ordering policy for each location while the second phase algorithm be use to determine the safety stock both algorithm could find solution that be as good as the solution from the mixed integer programming model in testing instance but they substantially reduce the computational time the solution be test with other instance have a period horizon where the average loss be within the expect service level and the number of period with an unsatisfied expect service level be less than of the planning horizon

374,CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas for enhanced oil recovery,"Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.Due to the climate change and global warming, the concern about CO2 emission into the atmosphere has been raised in many industries such as oil and gas business. The sources of CO2 include natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilisation. At the same time, oil production is expected to increase due to the higher consumption. CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield coupled with enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both requirements. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life. From this successful project, the technology is studied by applying it with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in the North of Thailand by using simulation model. It becomes the objective of this research, which is to evaluate CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas (WAG) for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effects the parameters, such as total hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injection and WAG ratio, on oil production and CO2 consumption and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. CMG software from Computer Modeling Group Ltd. is used to create the 3D simulation model to predict the CO2 storage in the geological formation. From the simulation, the results reported that oil can be produced up to 125,976 m3 of oil or 57 % recovery, CO2 consumption is 66,261 m3 of gas and CO2 utilisation is approximately 0.53 m3 of gas per m3 of oil. The main parameters for WAG process is WAG ratio in that oil production increases as WAG ratio increases. CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection. The results of this study can be applied to develop the CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the depleting oilfield in the North of Thailand for both oil production and CO2 storage.","['ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'CPE', 'CHE']",co geological storage couple with water alternate gas for enhance oil recovery copyright aidic servizi s r l due to the climate change and global warming the concern about co emission into the atmosphere have be raise in many industry such as oil and gas business the source of co include natural gas processing and other process the current technology to mitigate co be carbon capture storage and utilisation at the same time oil production be expect to increase due to the high consumption co geological storage in deplete oilfield couple with enhance oil recovery can be a well technology to meet both requirement the excellent example of this technology be the weyburn project in canada that can store co and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life from this successful project the technology be study by apply it with the deplete oilfield for both oil production and co storage in the north of thailand by use simulation model it become the objective of this research which be to evaluate co geological storage couple with water alternate gas wag for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effect the parameter such as total hydrocarbon pore volume hcpv injection and wag ratio on oil production and co consumption and sequestration for enhance oil recovery with the add benefit of carbon sequestration cmg software from computer modeling group ltd be use to create the d simulation model to predict the co storage in the geological formation from the simulation the result report that oil can be produce up to m of oil or recovery co consumption be m of gas and co utilisation be approximately m of gas per m of oil the main parameter for wag process be wag ratio in that oil production increase as wag ratio increase co consumption increase with total hcpv injection the result of this study can be apply to develop the co enhance oil recovery eor in the deplete oilfield in the north of thailand for both oil production and co storage
375,The environmental impact assessment of gold extraction processes for discarded computer RAM: a comparative study of two leaching chemicals,"© 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.Electrical and electronic equipment waste (WEEE) problems should be set as a priority in Thailand due to unpleasant operations. E-waste mismanagement caused by illegal transport of WEEE has intensified public health and environmental concerns. Computers are processed in recycling industries, but they still contain vulnerable metal remnants, such as gold. High-grade components, such as Random-Access Module (RAM), for example, are often extracted by hydrometallurgical processes through different leaching chemicals along with their related methods. Gold leaching agents, including aqua regia and cyanide-based solutions, were considered to extract gold from computer RAM in this study. Environmental impacts of the two extracting processes were investigated using material flow analysis and life cycle assessment, based on 1 kg of recovered gold. The effect of pulp density was also measured. The comparison between the two leaching processes without waste management demonstrated that the cyanide-based solution provided 8.5 times lower in terrestrial ecotoxicity and 6.4 times lower in human carcinogenic toxicity than aqua regia due to the lower overall chemical consumption. Nevertheless, proper wastewater treatments and a combination of incineration and landfill for solid waste treatment are potential options to minimize these impacts.","['ENV', 'METAL', 'CPE', 'CHE']",the environmental impact assessment of gold extraction process for discard computer ram a comparative study of two leach chemical springer japan kk part of springer nature electrical and electronic equipment waste weee problem should be set as a priority in thailand due to unpleasant operation e waste mismanagement cause by illegal transport of weee have intensify public health and environmental concern computer be process in recycle industry but they still contain vulnerable metal remnant such as gold high grade component such as random access module ram for example be often extract by hydrometallurgical process through different leaching chemical along with their relate method gold leach agent include aqua regia and cyanide base solution be consider to extract gold from computer ram in this study environmental impact of the two extract process be investigate use material flow analysis and life cycle assessment base on kg of recover gold the effect of pulp density be also measure the comparison between the two leach process without waste management demonstrate that the cyanide base solution provide time low in terrestrial ecotoxicity and time low in human carcinogenic toxicity than aqua regia due to the low overall chemical consumption nevertheless proper wastewater treatment and a combination of incineration and landfill for solid waste treatment be potential option to minimize these impact
376,Model Predictive Control of Energy Management System for Economic Dispatch with Application to MHS Microgrid in Normal Operation,"© 2019 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.Power generation in microgrid are conventionally decentralized making the grid management increasingly complex. Energy management system (EMS) is very important for power system planning and operation of microgrid. To make sure that the generation meets challenges of load profile requires more robust and effective EMS of microgrid. Specifically, the planning and operation of power supply needs to incorporate the load forecast for the optimal dispatch strategy. This paper proposes Model Predictive Control (MPC) of EMS to dispatch generation power in microgrid for minimum total operating cost. The load forecast is obtained by recurrent neural network for one day ahead. The efficiency and accuracy of load forecasting model affects the efficiency of dispatch algorithm of microgrid. The proposed algorithm is applied to a case study of Mae Hong Son (MHS) microgrid including battery energy storage system and power exchange with utility grid to satisfy load demand for both actual load and forecasted load profiles. We apply MPC to dispatch energy in normal operation and compare the total operating cost (TOC) with that of the previous EMS. It is found that the proposed MPC can significantly reduce TOC ranging from 25% to 45%.","['PE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'IE']",model predictive control of energy management system for economic dispatch with application to mhs microgrid in normal operation institute of control robotic and system icros power generation in microgrid be conventionally decentralized make the grid management increasingly complex energy management system ems be very important for power system planning and operation of microgrid to make sure that the generation meet challenge of load profile require more robust and effective em of microgrid specifically the planning and operation of power supply need to incorporate the load forecast for the optimal dispatch strategy this paper propose model predictive control mpc of ems to dispatch generation power in microgrid for minimum total operating cost the load forecast be obtain by recurrent neural network for one day ahead the efficiency and accuracy of load forecasting model affect the efficiency of dispatch algorithm of microgrid the propose algorithm be apply to a case study of mae hong son mhs microgrid include battery energy storage system and power exchange with utility grid to satisfy load demand for both actual load and forecast load profile we apply mpc to dispatch energy in normal operation and compare the total operating cost toc with that of the previous ems it be find that the propose mpc can significantly reduce toc range from to

378,Asphalt incorporation with ethylene vinyl acetate (Eva) copolymer and natural rubber (nr) thermoplastic vulcanizates (tpvs): Effects of tpv gel content on physical and rheological properties,"© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Plastic waste has been incorporated with asphalt to improve the physical properties of asphalt and alleviate the increasing trend of plastic waste being introduced into the environment. However, plastic waste comes in different types such as thermoplastic or thermoset, which results in varied properties of polymer modified asphalt (PMA). In this work, four thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) were prepared using different peroxide concentrations to produce four formulations of gel content (with varying extent of crosslinked part) in order to imitate the variation of plastic waste. All four TPVs were then mixed with asphalt at 5 wt% thus producing four formulations of PMA, which went through physical, rheological, and storage stability assessments. PMA with higher gel content possessed lower penetration and higher softening temperature, indicating physically harder appearance of PMA. Superpave parameters remained unchanged among different gel content PMA at temperatures of 64, 70, and 76◦ C. PMA with any level of gel content had lower Brookfield viscosity than PMA without gel content at a temperature of 135◦ C. Higher gel content resulted in shorter storage stability measured with greater different softening temperatures between top and bottom layers of PMA after 5 days of 163◦ C storage. This study shows that asphalt with thermoset plastic waste is harder and easier to pave, thus making the non-recycling thermoset plastic waste more useful and friendly to the environment.","['CE', 'CHE', 'MATENG']",asphalt incorporation with ethylene vinyl acetate eva copolymer and natural rubber nr thermoplastic vulcanizate tpvs effect of tpv gel content on physical and rheological property by the author licensee mdpi basel switzerland plastic waste have be incorporate with asphalt to improve the physical property of asphalt and alleviate the increase trend of plastic waste be introduce into the environment however plastic waste come in different type such as thermoplastic or thermoset which result in varied property of polymer modify asphalt pma in this work four thermoplastic vulcanizate tpvs be prepare use different peroxide concentration to produce four formulation of gel content with vary extent of crosslinke part in order to imitate the variation of plastic waste all four tpvs be then mix with asphalt at wt thus produce four formulation of pma which go through physical rheological and storage stability assessment pma with high gel content possess low penetration and high soften temperature indicate physically hard appearance of pma superpave parameter remain unchanged among different gel content pma at temperature of and c pma with any level of gel content have low brookfield viscosity than pma without gel content at a temperature of c high gel content result in short storage stability measure with great different soften temperature between top and bottom layer of pma after day of c storage this study show that asphalt with thermoset plastic waste be hard and easy to pave thus make the non recycling thermoset plastic waste more useful and friendly to the environment

384,Hierarchical Verification for the BPMN Design Model Using State Space Analysis,"© 2013 IEEE.The BPMN design models are widely used in the software development process. Owing to the lack of BPMN standard semantics, formal verification is used to validate whether the BPMN design model is free of undesirable properties. The primary challenges of BPMN design model verification are the enormous size and complexity of BPMN design models; these challenges may lead to time-consuming processes for model abstraction and overcoming the state space explosion problem. This paper proposes a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis based on a colored Petri net (CPN). A BPMN partitioning technique and rules for the transformation of a BPMN into a CPN model are provided. The partitioning approach supports the unstructured BPMN design model, and the obtained CPN model also supports hierarchical verification. To validate and analyze the BPMN design model, the transformation technique and state space generator are implemented as a BPMN verification framework. This method is a viable option for the software process designers and is suitable for the large-scale BPMN design model verification.","['CPE', 'MATH']",hierarchical verification for the bpmn design model use state space analysis ieee the bpmn design model be widely use in the software development process owe to the lack of bpmn standard semantic formal verification be use to validate whether the bpmn design model be free of undesirable property the primary challenge of bpmn design model verification be the enormous size and complexity of bpmn design model these challenge may lead to time consume process for model abstraction and overcome the state space explosion problem this paper propose a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis base on a colored petri net cpn a bpmn partition technique and rule for the transformation of a bpmn into a cpn model be provide the partition approach support the unstructured bpmn design model and the obtain cpn model also support hierarchical verification to validate and analyze the bpmn design model the transformation technique and state space generator be implement as a bpmn verification framework this method be a viable option for the software process designer and be suitable for the large scale bpmn design model verification
385,Composite membranes of graphene oxide for CO2/CH4 separation,"© 2019 Society of Chemical IndustryBACKGROUND: Biogas is an alternative renewable energy produced by anaerobic digestion of various organic wastes mainly from agriculture, households and biomass and food industries. Typically, raw biogas consists of 50–70% methane (CH4), 30–50% carbon dioxide (CO2), and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water vapour. Purifying biogas by removing CO2 and other trace impurities is required in order to achieve higher calorific value, safe operation and to meet fuel standards. As CO2 is the second largest component of biogas, this study focused on its removal from CH4. RESULTS: Composite membranes of blended PEG 400/Pebax 1657 polymer and graphene oxide (GO) were developed for CO2/CH4 gas separation. The effects of GO loading and PEG 400 addition on CO2/CH4 separation performance were investigated. Optimal loadings of 0.25 wt% GO and 50 wt% PEG 400 obtained the best membrane performance with 12.4 GPU of CO2 permeance and 14 of CO2/CH4 separation factor. CONCLUSION: Incorporating GO to the polymer membrane enhanced CO2/CH4 separation, whereas PEG 400 addition increased CO2 permeance. The advantages from each component led to an enhancement of CO2 permeance and CO2/CH4 separation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","['PE', 'NANO', 'CHE']",composite membrane of graphene oxide for co ch separation society of chemical industrybackground biogas be an alternative renewable energy produce by anaerobic digestion of various organic waste mainly from agriculture household and biomass and food industry typically raw biogas consist of methane ch carbon dioxide co and small amount of hydrogen sulfide h s and water vapour purify biogas by remove co and other trace impurity be require in order to achieve high calorific value safe operation and to meet fuel standard as co be the second large component of biogas this study focus on its removal from ch result composite membrane of blended peg pebax polymer and graphene oxide go be develop for co ch gas separation the effect of go loading and peg addition on co ch separation performance be investigate optimal loading of wt go and wt peg obtain the good membrane performance with gpu of co permeance and of co ch separation factor conclusion incorporate go to the polymer membrane enhance co ch separation whereas peg addition increase co permeance the advantage from each component lead to an enhancement of co permeance and co ch separation society of chemical industry
386,Improvement of product selectivity in bicarbonate reduction into formic acid on a tin-based catalyst by integrating nano-diamond particles,"© 2018 Institution of Chemical EngineersIn this study, the efficiency of electrochemical reduction of bicarbonate into formic acid was improved by using a composite electrode made up of tin (Sn), nanodiamond (ND) and carbon nanotube (CNT). In the absence of ND, a compositional ratio of 10/90 (Sn/CNT) demonstrated the highest current density. However, by adding ND in a compositional ratio of 10/90/100 (Sn/CNT/ND) the highest efficiency towards formate/formic acid was achieved. It was observed that the presence of ND enhanced the selectivity of product for formic acid. The effects of bicarbonate concentration and scan rate have also been studied to understand the reduction mechanism. The peak potential shifted towards larger negative values of applied potential with an increase in the scan rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V/s, confirming the irreversible nature of the reduction process. The linear relationship between the current and the square root of the scan rate (with a slope value of 0.519) suggested that the reaction process is fully diffusion-controlled. Formic acid was produced using both electrodes; however, the electrode containing nano-diamond successfully improved the process yield for formic acid.

387,Gasification of Furniture Waste Sawdust in a Cyclone Gasifier,"© 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Sawdust is one of the major biomass that was produced over 1 million ton per year in Thailand. A large amount of sawdust can be used as renewable energy. Gasification is one of the high-efficiency processes to convert biomass to the gaseous product. Sawdust is suitable to be converted to the gaseous product due to its high proportion of volatile (73%). In this work, sawdust thermal conversion was investigated by using a stairmand type cyclone gasifier with 100 mm diameter. The operation of the cyclone with short residence time and high efficiency of particulate separation from the gaseous product is suitable for a small particle like sawdust. The influences of equivalence ratio (0.15-0.60) and reactor temperature (700°C , 800°C and 900°C ) on the waste conversion performance were determined. The gas composition (CO, CO2, CH4, H2, and CnHm), carbon and hydrogen conversions, lower heating value and cold gasification efficiency were reported. The data analysis indicated the optimum equivalence ratio is 0.45. Excessively lower or higher equivalence ratio negatively affected the gas composition and heating value of gaseous product. The optimum of reactor temperature is 900°C . The lower temperature also adversely affected the gaseous product, conversion of carbon and hydrogen. The lower heating value of product gas is range from 0.95-3.45 MJ/m3 and the cold gasification efficiency is range from 28-68%.

389,Bond properties between carbon fibre-reinforced polymer plate and fire-damaged concrete,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdIn this research, a single-shear test was conducted to investigate the bond properties between carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates and fire-damaged concrete prisms. The investigation focused on the effects of fire exposure condition and the presence of internal steel reinforcements on the effective bond length, failure mode, bond strength (maximum joint load) and interfacial fracture energy. After being air-cooled, the concrete prisms were adhesively bonded with CFRP strips of different lengths, and then quasi-static tested at the ambient condition. The pull-off test results showed that the tensile strength of concrete substrate decreased after being exposed to elevated temperatures. Such deterioration of concrete substrate caused an increase in the effective bond length. It also decreased the bond strength and interfacial fracture energy.

390,Information embedding in 3D printed objects using metal-infused PLA and reading with thermography,"© 2018 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.Digital fabrication has the potential to innovate manufacturing and logistics in the near future. An attempt to increase the value of real fabricated objects by embedding information and including copyright protection is often proposed. We present a new technique for embedding information using metal fused materials (Copper powder-infused PLA) to form a fine structure inside the 3D printed objects. Then, information can be detected nondestructively by thermography. Our experiment proved that a binary code array of metal-infused material can be successfully printed and embedded inside a sample of fabricated 3D based objects (ABS). In the thermal image, the implanted structure areas were clearly observed with temperature conditions different from the surroundings. We also studied the factors that influence the quality of readouts, such as how deeply infused-metal is embedded from the surface, the colors of the filament substances, and the clearance of the image binary code compared to previous methods. The best condition was embedding metal-infused material 1 mm deep from the surface. Moreover, the color of the printing filament had no effect on the quality of the read-out information. These results mean that we can increase the value added to various kinds of objects fabricated with 3D printers more conveniently.","['METAL', 'CPE', 'OPTIC', 'EDU']",information embed in d print object use metal infuse pla and read with thermography society for image science and technology digital fabrication have the potential to innovate manufacturing and logistic in the near future an attempt to increase the value of real fabricate object by embed information and include copyright protection be often propose we present a new technique for embed information use metal fuse material copper powder infuse pla to form a fine structure inside the d print object then information can be detect nondestructively by thermography our experiment prove that a binary code array of metal infuse material can be successfully print and embed inside a sample of fabricate d base object ab in the thermal image the implant structure area be clearly observe with temperature condition different from the surrounding we also study the factor that influence the quality of readout such as how deeply infuse metal be embed from the surface the color of the filament substance and the clearance of the image binary code compare to previous method the good condition be embed metal infuse material mm deep from the surface moreover the color of the printing filament have no effect on the quality of the read out information these result mean that we can increase the value add to various kind of object fabricate with d printer more conveniently
391,Very Short-Term Solar Power Forecasting Using Genetic Algorithm Based Deep Neural Network,"© 2019 IEEE.This paper presents a method for finding optimal parameters of a deep learning model by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is employed to forecast output of a solar farm 4 hours in advance. Its inputs are from both forecasted weather data and data obtained from weather monitoring instrument. Performance of four NN (Neural Network) types: DNN (Deep Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and CuDNNGRU (Cuda Deep Neural Network Gated Recurrent Unit), is compared. Feature engineering by Exponential Moving Average (EMA) finds that a time-series of irradiance helps to improve the model performance. GA is exploited to find the most appropriate the number of lookback (or the window size), and the number of neurons in each and all three hidden layers. The GRU model yields the least RMSE at 7.83%.

393,Application of Sensor Technology for Warning Unsafe Conditions from Moving Objects above Construction Workers,"© 2018 IEEE.Moving objects above construction workers is one of the major causations of accidents at construction sites. The dynamic and complex nature of construction sites can lead to the above unsafe conditions. However, previous research has developed sensor system for detecting the accident which can only be applied to crane prototype in laboratory. The objective of this research is to develop a sensor warning system (SW system) for warning construction workers from unsafe conditions. This study focuses on a lifting operation of the tower crane. The SW system is developed based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, GPS sensor, and server. In this paper, the pilot test was conducted on testing GPS devices which could lead to determine the distance error and calibrate the system. As a result, the average of distance error was 1.96 meters for calibrating the system. Further study will continue to develop the full-scale system which can be applied to construction site.","['CPE', 'EDU', 'SAFETY']",application of sensor technology for warn unsafe condition from move object above construction worker ieee move object above construction worker be one of the major causation of accident at construction site the dynamic and complex nature of construction site can lead to the above unsafe condition however previous research have develop sensor system for detect the accident which can only be apply to crane prototype in laboratory the objective of this research be to develop a sensor warning system sw system for warn construction worker from unsafe condition this study focus on a lifting operation of the tower crane the sw system be develop base on the internet of thing iot concept gps sensor and server in this paper the pilot test be conduct on test gps device which could lead to determine the distance error and calibrate the system as a result the average of distance error be meter for calibrate the system further study will continue to develop the full scale system which can be apply to construction site
394,Heuristic Based Scheduling for Toothpaste Filling Problem,"© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.This research focuses on the development of a heuristic method for the Toothpaste Filling Problem (TFP) whose complication lies on a vast variety of products (formulae and sizes), together with specific restrictions on filling machines and storage tanks. More specifically, filling machines are non-identical, each of which has different speeds and capacities for filling toothpaste of various sizes. As unloading requires storage tanks, each with much larger capacity when compared to one particular production order, a tank will be then matched with several production orders and be repositioned among filling machines to avoid unnecessary changeovers. We solve the TFP by means of a two-phase method, where the initial solution is constructed by an Earliest Due Date (EDD) dispatching rule. Once completed, the initial solution is then iteratively improved by a series of improvement operators, mimicking the concept of Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS), until no improvement could be found. We test our heuristic on a set of sample instances acquired from one of the biggest consumer products manufacturers in Thailand. Impressively, when compared to the current practice, our proposed heuristic could help reduce makespan by 32% on average, or equivalently an annual saving of $0.6 million, mainly from the reduction on overtime payment and changeovers.","['METAL', 'ME', 'MATH']",heuristic base scheduling for toothpaste filling problem iop publish ltd all right reserve this research focus on the development of a heuristic method for the toothpaste filling problem tfp whose complication lie on a vast variety of product formulae and size together with specific restriction on filling machine and storage tank more specifically fill machine be non identical each of which have different speed and capacity for fill toothpaste of various size as unloading require storage tank each with much large capacity when compare to one particular production order a tank will be then match with several production order and be reposition among fill machine to avoid unnecessary changeover we solve the tfp by mean of a two phase method where the initial solution be construct by an early due date edd dispatching rule once complete the initial solution be then iteratively improve by a series of improvement operator mimic the concept of variable neighbourhood search vns until no improvement could be find we test our heuristic on a set of sample instance acquire from one of the big consumer product manufacturer in thailand impressively when compare to the current practice our propose heuristic could help reduce makespan by on average or equivalently an annual saving of million mainly from the reduction on overtime payment and changeover
395,Observation of increased dispersion of pt and mobility of oxygen in Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with la modification in CO oxidation,"Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The study focuses on an improvement of the catalytic activity via CO oxidation for Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by addition of La onto the support prior to impregnation with Pt metals. The molar ratios of La/Al were varied from 0.01 to 0.15. Based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, La addition ap-parently resulted in increased basicity of the catalysts, which is related to increasing of oxygen mobili-ty. However, when considered the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption, it was found that Pt dispersion also increased with increasing the amount of La addition up to La/Al = 0.05. It is suggested that too high amount of La addition can inhibit the dispersion Pt due to surface coverage of La. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation essentially depends on both Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimposed on each other. Based on this study, the Pt/?-Al2O3 catalyst with La addition of La/Al molar ratio = 0.05 showed the highest activity due to its optimal Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility leading to its highest value of turnover frequency (TOF).","['METAL', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",observation of increase dispersion of pt and mobility of oxygen in pt γ al o catalyst with la modification in co oxidation copyright bcrec group all right reserve the study focus on an improvement of the catalytic activity via co oxidation for pt γ al o catalyst by addition of la onto the support prior to impregnation with pt metal the molar ratio of la al be varied from to base on temperature program desorption tpd of co la addition ap parently result in increase basicity of the catalyst which be relate to increase of oxygen mobili ty however when consider the pt dispersion measure by co chemisorption it be find that pt dispersion also increase with increase the amount of la addition up to la al it be suggest that too high amount of la addition can inhibit the dispersion pt due to surface coverage of la it be worth note that the catalytic activity toward co oxidation essentially depend on both pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimpose on each other base on this study the pt al o catalyst with la addition of la al molar ratio show the high activity due to its optimal pt dispersion and oxygen mobility lead to its high value of turnover frequency tof
396,Quantitative analysis of calcium carbonate formation in magnetized water,"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.This research studies the influence of static magnetic fields on the structure of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystals. Experiments were conducted by exposing Ca2+ and CO3 2− solutions to magnetic fields. The solutions were then combined to form CaCO3 particles. Three characteristics of CaCO3 formation reaction have been investigated, namely absorbance differentiation, vibrational modes and crystal structure. Absorbances were measured using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer, while vibrational modes were measured using Flourier transform (FT) infrared and FT Raman spectroscopies. X-ray diffractometer was used to determine the crystal structure. Experimental results show that the nucleation of CaCO3 crystals was inhibited when starting solutions were exposed to magnetic fields. The effect of magnetic fields was mainly attributed to CO3 2− solution and remained for more than 144 h after starting solutions were combined. As various magnetic field strengths were applied to the solutions, aragonite was formed, and aragonite/calcite ratios were proportional to magnetic field strengths. Using the X-ray technique, the measured crystal structure indicated that the aragonite/calcite ratio increased from 10 to 82% when the magnetic field strength was increased from 60 to 460 mT for the duration of 8 min.","['PE', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",quantitative analysis of calcium carbonate formation in magnetized water elsevi b v this research study the influence of static magnetic field on the structure of calcium carbonate caco crystal experiment be conduct by expose ca and co solution to magnetic field the solution be then combine to form caco particle three characteristic of caco formation reaction have be investigate namely absorbance differentiation vibrational mode and crystal structure absorbance be measure use ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer while vibrational mode be measure use flouri transform ft infrared and ft raman spectroscopies x ray diffractometer be use to determine the crystal structure experimental result show that the nucleation of caco crystal be inhibit when start solution be expose to magnetic field the effect of magnetic field be mainly attribute to co solution and remain for more than h after start solution be combine as various magnetic field strength be apply to the solution aragonite be form and aragonite calcite ratio be proportional to magnetic field strength use the x ray technique the measured crystal structure indicate that the aragonite calcite ratio increase from to when the magnetic field strength be increase from to mt for the duration of min

The chamber will be used to control the atmospheric condition around the 10 cm diameter sphere-gap in a vertical arrangement. The geometry of the simulation model followed the vertical sphere-gap of the standard IEC60052, by taking into account clearance limits of spheres. The mesh size and the boundary size of the simulation model are chosen by considering both simulation accuracy and time. The maximum electric field between the model of sphere-gap with and without the chamber are recorded and compared. The results show that the chamber with metal cover has a strong effect on the maximum electric field, Emax, of the sphere-gap, while the chamber with insulation cover has an acceptable deviation of Emax.","['EE', 'MATH']",the design of sphere gap test chamber use finite element method ieeethis paper investigate the effect of an enclose chamber on the electric field distribution of standard sphere gap by use finite element method fem the chamber will be use to control the atmospheric condition around the cm diameter sphere gap in a vertical arrangement the geometry of the simulation model follow the vertical sphere gap of the standard iec by take into account clearance limit of sphere the mesh size and the boundary size of the simulation model be choose by consider both simulation accuracy and time the maximum electric field between the model of sphere gap with and without the chamber be record and compare the result show that the chamber with metal cover have a strong effect on the maximum electric field emax of the sphere gap while the chamber with insulation cover have an acceptable deviation of emax
398,Influence of rice husk ash on mechanical properties and fire resistance of recycled aggregate high-calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete,"© 2019 Elsevier LtdThe use of recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete provides an eco-friendly alternative for the construction industry. Since geopolymer concretes made with recycled aggregates generally have weaker internal structure compared with those using natural aggregates, SiO2-rich materials have therefore been used to improve the strength properties, one of which is the well-known nano-SiO2 (nS). However, because nS is not environmental friendly, other green SiO2-rich materials, such as rice husk ash (RHA) from agricultural wastes, are needed. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of replacing nano-SiO2 with rich husk ash for improving the performance of recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete (RAGC) made from high-calcium fly ash that is able to set and harden without heat curing. The mechanical properties and fire-resistant performance of RHA-added and nS-added geopolymer concretes were tested and compared. The results show that the addition of RHA is effective in improving the strengths of RAGCs, particularly when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is increased to 4.17. The 28-day compressive strengths of RAGCs containing RHAs ranged from 36.0 to 38.1 MPa due to the improved microstructure and denser matrix and were comparable to those of RAGCs made with nS. However, the inclusion of SiO2-rich materials had an adverse effect on the post-fire residual strength of geopolymer concretes made from recycled aggregates due primarily to the reduced porosity.","['CE', 'ENV', 'METAL', 'MATENG', 'AGRI', 'SAFETY']",influence of rice husk ash on mechanical property and fire resistance of recycle aggregate high calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete elsevi ltdthe use of recycle aggregate in geopolymer concrete provide an eco friendly alternative for the construction industry since geopolymer concrete make with recycle aggregate generally have weak internal structure compare with those use natural aggregate sio rich material have therefore be use to improve the strength property one of which be the well know nano sio n however because ns be not environmental friendly other green sio rich material such as rice husk ash rha from agricultural waste be need the objective of this study be to investigate the effectiveness of replace nano sio with rich husk ash for improve the performance of recycle aggregate geopolymer concrete ragc make from high calcium fly ash that be able to set and harden without heat cure the mechanical property and fire resistant performance of rha add and n add geopolymer concrete be test and compare the result show that the addition of rha be effective in improve the strength of ragcs particularly when the sio al o ratio be increase to the day compressive strength of ragcs contain rha range from to mpa due to the improved microstructure and denser matrix and be comparable to those of ragcs make with ns however the inclusion of sio rich material have an adverse effect on the post fire residual strength of geopolymer concrete make from recycle aggregate due primarily to the reduced porosity
399,Comparison of diaphragm wall movement prediction and field performance for different construction techniques,"© 2019 Tongji University and Tongji University PressThe demand for deep excavation for basement construction is growing rapidly in Bangkok due to the limited availability of land. Recently, the maximum depth of excavation has increased up to approximately −25 m. Deep excavation in Bangkok subsoils requires consideration of the soil conditions and the real piezometric level of ground water. In general, Bangkok subsoil consists of 13~16 m of thick, dark grey soft-to-medium clay, followed by stiff, silty clay, before the first sand layer at 21~30 m. The piezometric level of ground water has risen to −13 m from its previous level of −23 m due to the control of deep well pumping for twenty years by the Thai Government. A diaphragm wall is normally used as a soil retaining structure. The behavior and performance of a diaphragm wall is usually predicted by the finite element method (FEM) using Mohr–Coulomb soil modeling as failure criteria, with the soil modulus parameters for soft and stiff Bangkok clay from the self-boring pressuremeter test. This paper presents a comparison between the diaphragm wall movements from FEM analysis predictions and field measurements for two projects, the new Bank of Thailand head office and the Rosewood Hotel, which were constructed with different techniques. The predicted movement agreed well with the field measurements.","['CE', 'ENV', 'PE', 'ME', 'MATH']",comparison of diaphragm wall movement prediction and field performance for different construction technique tongji university and tongji university pressthe demand for deep excavation for basement construction be grow rapidly in bangkok due to the limited availability of land recently the maximum depth of excavation have increase up to approximately m deep excavation in bangkok subsoil require consideration of the soil condition and the real piezometric level of ground water in general bangkok subsoil consist of m of thick dark grey soft to medium clay follow by stiff silty clay before the first sand layer at m the piezometric level of ground water have rise to m from its previous level of m due to the control of deep well pump for twenty year by the thai government a diaphragm wall be normally use as a soil retain structure the behavior and performance of a diaphragm wall be usually predict by the finite element method fem use mohr coulomb soil model as failure criterion with the soil modulus parameter for soft and stiff bangkok clay from the self boring pressuremeter test this paper present a comparison between the diaphragm wall movement from fem analysis prediction and field measurement for two project the new bank of thailand head office and the rosewood hotel which be construct with different technique the predict movement agree well with the field measurement

401,Impacts of Coastal Development on the Shoreline Change of the Eastern Gulf of Thailand,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The Map Ta Phut (MTP) Port has been developed on the middle portion of the Rayong Bay, Thailand, since 1992. After the expansion of the port completed in 2002, the port has an approximately 3.5 km wide and extending 4.0 km seaward. This paper provides the assessment of the construction of the MTP Port project on the shoreline of the Rayong Bay. Historical shoreline positions were extracted from aerial photography and satellite imagery taken between 1957 and 2016 using ArcGIS version 10.4. The rates of shoreline changes pre- and post-port development were implemented using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Results indicate that the Rayong Bay shoreline mostly was in dynamic equilibrium with an average rate of less than 0.5 m/y prior the construction of the MTP port. After the completion of the port, a significant shoreline accretion has continuously been found along the shoreline of about 500 m adjacent to both sides of the port. Meanwhile, the Rayong Bay shoreline had been eroded about 28 % of the total shoreline after the port completed in 1992 and increased to 30% after the port expansion in 2002. Coastal protection structures included seawalls, segment breakwater, Y-shaped groins, and jetty were applied along the receded shore. Most of those structures have successfully stabilized the shoreline, and the Rayong Bay has likely reached a new dynamic equilibrium since 2011.","['CE', 'OPTIC']",impact of coastal development on the shoreline change of the eastern gulf of thailand publish under licence by iop publish ltd the map ta phut mtp port have be develop on the middle portion of the rayong bay thailand since after the expansion of the port complete in the port have an approximately km wide and extend km seaward this paper provide the assessment of the construction of the mtp port project on the shoreline of the rayong bay historical shoreline position be extract from aerial photography and satellite imagery take between and use arcgis version the rate of shoreline change pre and post port development be implement use the digital shoreline analysis system dsas result indicate that the rayong bay shoreline mostly be in dynamic equilibrium with an average rate of less than m y prior the construction of the mtp port after the completion of the port a significant shoreline accretion have continuously be find along the shoreline of about m adjacent to both side of the port meanwhile the rayong bay shoreline have be erode about of the total shoreline after the port complete in and increase to after the port expansion in coastal protection structure include seawall segment breakwater y shape groin and jetty be apply along the recede shore most of those structure have successfully stabilize the shoreline and the rayong bay have likely reach a new dynamic equilibrium since
402,"Dichlorocarbene modified butadiene rubber (DCBR): Preparation, kinetic study, and its properties in natural rubber/DCBR blend vulcanizates","Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Dichlorocarbene modified butadiene rubber (DCBR) was prepared via the addition of the dichlorocarbene group in the presence of 2 phase transfer agents (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and tetraethylammonium chloride). The effects of the reaction temperature and time, amount of dichlorocarbene precursor, and the type and amount of phase transfer agent on the chlorine content were investigated. The highest chlorine content (30%) in DCBR was obtained using 0.062 mol chloroform and 0.003 mol cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at room temperature for 19 hours although 27.9% was obtained after 12 hours. The kinetics of this dichlorocarbene modification was best described by the pseudo–first order rate law with 2 rate constants. For practical applications, the DCBR with chlorine contents of 10%, 20%, or 30% were blended with natural rubber (NR) and then vulcanized using the sulfur-curing system. Although the polarity of DCBR was increased, a good compatibility between NR and DCBR still existed, resulting in improved mechanical properties. The oil resistance, flame retardant, and ozone resistance properties of the NR/DCBR blend vulcanizates were enhanced compared to those of a NR/butadiene rubber blend vulcanizate, which was related to the amount of chlorine incorporated into the DCBR.","['ME', 'CHE', 'MATENG', 'SAFETY', 'MATSCI']",dichlorocarbene modify butadiene rubber dcbr preparation kinetic study and its property in natural rubber dcbr blend vulcanizate copyright john wiley sons ltd dichlorocarbene modify butadiene rubber dcbr be prepare via the addition of the dichlorocarbene group in the presence of phase transfer agent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and tetraethylammonium chloride the effect of the reaction temperature and time amount of dichlorocarbene precursor and the type and amount of phase transfer agent on the chlorine content be investigate the high chlorine content in dcbr be obtain use mol chloroform and mol cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at room temperature for hour although be obtain after hour the kinetic of this dichlorocarbene modification be well describe by the pseudo first order rate law with rate constant for practical application the dcbr with chlorine content of or be blend with natural rubber nr and then vulcanize use the sulfur cure system although the polarity of dcbr be increase a good compatibility between nr and dcbr still exist result in improve mechanical property the oil resistance flame retardant and ozone resistance property of the nr dcbr blend vulcanizate be enhance compare to those of a nr butadiene rubber blend vulcanizate which be relate to the amount of chlorine incorporate into the dcbr
403,Assessment of shear resistance of corroded beams repaired using SFRC in the tension zone,"Copyright © 2021 Techno-Press, Ltd.This study experimentally and analytically investigates the shear behavior of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) beams repaired using steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) in the flexural zone. The experimental parameters are the corrosion degree (0%, 12%, and 17%) and the steel fiber volume in the SFRC (1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%). The test results reveal that corrosion degree significantly affects the shear resistance of the beams. The shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 17% was higher than that of the uncorroded beam, whereas the shear capacity of the beam with the corrosion degree of 12% was lower than that of the uncorroded beam. The shear efficiency of damaged beams can be recovered by repairing them using SFRC that contains a reasonable amount of steel fibers. In addition, two methods to estimate the shear capacity of the repaired beams are developed using the modified truss analogy and strut-and-tie models.

405,"Green diesel production through simultaneous deoxygenation of palmitic acid and desulfurization of 4,6-Dimethyl-dibenzothiophene over commercial CoMo/Al2O3","© 2018 BRTeam.This study investigated the deoxygenation of palmitic acid as a model compound of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), in the presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene as a sulfur-containing light gas oil (LGO). Reactions were performed at the pressure of 25 barg, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 1.7 h-1, and H2/oil of 630 NL/L over CoMo/Al2O3 as catalyst. The effect of temperature was studied in the range of 275-300 °C. Both deoxygenation and desulfurization led to approximately 100% conversions at 300 °C, while at 275 °C, palmitic acid deoxygenation was recorded at a higher conversion rate compared with that of the desulfurization of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene. The presence of 4,6- di-methyl-di-benzothiophene during the deoxygenation of palmitic acid resulted in high conversions (>95%).

407,"Analyzing Suicide and Contributing Factors in Thailand Using Classification by Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine","© 2023 IEEE.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 700,000 people die from suicide each year, with the number of attempts far exceeding that. Suicide is also the fourth leading cause of death among teenagers [1]. The suicide rate in Thailand follows a similar trend. This research aims to utilize machine learning techniques to identify cases that lead to suicide deaths and to study the contributing factors, both internal and external. Specifically, this paper proposes using classification methods to create a prediction model from people's demography, behaviors, and other factors in order to analyze features that influence the risk of suicide deaths.

408,Robust Compression Technique for YOLOv3 on Real-Time Vehicle Detection,"© 2019 IEEE.For vehicle detection, YOLOv3 has shown promising accuracy. Since the number of parameters in this network can be more than ten million parameters, it cannot be fit into a commodity camera. In this paper, we propose a compression mechanism designed specifically for YOLOv 3's network by removing unnecessary filters. Since YOLOv3 composes of two network components: backbone and pyramid networks, we propose a robust pruning mechanism to prune filters of each network separately. This can help to avoid over-pruning the network in some part of the model making our model more robust. There are two main pruning criteria investigated: Average Percentage of Zero (APoZ) and Sum Magnitude Weight. The experiment was conducted on UA-DETRAC. The results show that our compression mechanism with APoZ criterion can reduce more than 90% of the network size, while the accuracy is even higher than the full model for about 2%.",['CPE'],robust compression technique for yolov on real time vehicle detection ieee for vehicle detection yolov have show promising accuracy since the number of parameter in this network can be more than ten million parameter it can not be fit into a commodity camera in this paper we propose a compression mechanism design specifically for yolov s network by remove unnecessary filter since yolov compose of two network component backbone and pyramid network we propose a robust pruning mechanism to prune filter of each network separately this can help to avoid over prune the network in some part of the model make our model more robust there be two main pruning criterion investigate average percentage of zero apoz and sum magnitude weight the experiment be conduct on ua detrac the result show that our compression mechanism with apoz criterion can reduce more than of the network size while the accuracy be even high than the full model for about

The problem comes from high loss time because the system's parameters are not set properly and high setup time of the machine. Therefore, the operations efficiency improvement has been conducted by setting a suitable flow rate at the splicer and changing activities of the operator in order to reduce waiting time. Improved efficiency is implemented in the Ply cutting machine from July 2018 to August 2018. The result shows the increase in the average production from 23 rolls/shift to 28 rolls/shift. Furthermore, a cost saving for efficiency improvement is equal to 36M baht per year.","['EDU', 'IE']",operational efficiency improvement of ply cut machine for aircraft tire publish under licence by iop publish ltd this research focus on the operational efficiency improvement of ply cut machine for aircraft tire by implement the design of experiment doe and single minute exchange of die smed method to decrease loss time cause by machine stoppage find at let off and splicer process the problem come from high loss time because the system s parameter be not set properly and high setup time of the machine therefore the operation efficiency improvement have be conduct by set a suitable flow rate at the splicer and change activity of the operator in order to reduce waiting time improve efficiency be implement in the ply cut machine from july to august the result show the increase in the average production from roll shift to roll shift furthermore a cost saving for efficiency improvement be equal to m baht per year
411,Monitoring of Surface Roughness in Aluminium Turning Process,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.As the turning process is one of the most necessary process. The surface roughness has been considered for the quality of workpiece. There are many factors which affect the surface roughness. Hence, the objective of this research is to monitor the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting forces in aluminium turning process with a wide range of cutting conditions. The coated carbide tool and aluminium alloy (Al 6063) are used for this experiment. The cutting parameters are investigated to analyze the effects of them on the surface roughness which are the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius and the depth of cut. In the case of this research, the dynamometer is installed in the turret of CNC turning machine to generate a signal while turning. The relation between dynamic cutting forces and the surface roughness profile is examined by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The experimentally obtained results showed that the cutting force depends on the cutting condition. The surface roughness can be improved when increasing the cutting speed and the tool nose radius in contrast to the feed rate and the depth of cut. The relation between the cutting parameters and the surface roughness can be explained by the in-process cutting forces. It is understood that the in-process cutting forces are able to predict the surface roughness in the further research.","['METAL', 'ME', 'MATENG', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",monitoring of surface roughness in aluminium turning process publish under licence by iop publish ltd as the turning process be one of the most necessary process the surface roughness have be consider for the quality of workpiece there be many factor which affect the surface roughness hence the objective of this research be to monitor the relation between the surface roughness and the cut force in aluminium turning process with a wide range of cut condition the coat carbide tool and aluminium alloy al be use for this experiment the cut parameter be investigate to analyze the effect of they on the surface roughness which be the cutting speed the feed rate the tool nose radius and the depth of cut in the case of this research the dynamometer be instal in the turret of cnc turn machine to generate a signal while turn the relation between dynamic cutting force and the surface roughness profile be examine by apply the fast fouri transform fft the experimentally obtain result show that the cut force depend on the cutting condition the surface roughness can be improve when increase the cut speed and the tool nose radius in contrast to the feed rate and the depth of cut the relation between the cut parameter and the surface roughness can be explain by the in process cut force it be understand that the in process cut force be able to predict the surface roughness in the further research
412,Investigation of leukocyte viability and damage in spiral microchannel and contraction-expansion array,"© 2019 by the authors.Inertial separation techniques in a microfluidic system have been widely employed in the field of medical diagnosis for a long time. Despite no requirement of external forces, it requires strong hydrodynamic forces that could potentially cause cell damage or loss during the separation process. This might lead to the wrong interpretation of laboratory results since the change of structures and functional characteristics of cells due to the hydrodynamic forces that occur are not taken into account. Therefore, it is important to investigate the cell viability and damage along with the separation efficacy of the device in the design process. In this study, two inertial separation techniques-spiral microchannel and contraction-expansion array (CEA)-were examined to evaluate cell viability, morphology and intracellular structures using a trypan blue assay (TB), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Wright-Giemsa stain. We discovered that cell loss was not significantly found in a feeding system, i.e., syringe, needle and tube, but mostly occurred in the inertial separation devices while the change of cell morphology and intracellular structures were found in the feeding system and inertial separation devices. Furthermore, percentage of cell loss was not significant in both devices (7-10%). However, the change of cell morphology was considerably increased (30%) in spiral microchannel (shear stress dominated) rather than in CEA (12%). In contrast, the disruption of intracellular structures was increased (14%) in CEA (extensional and shear stress dominated equally) rather than spiral microchannel (2%). In these experiments, leukocytes of canine were used as samples because their sizes are varied in a range between 7-12 μm, and they are commonly used as a biomarker in many clinical and medical applications.","['BME', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",investigation of leukocyte viability and damage in spiral microchannel and contraction expansion array by the author inertial separation technique in a microfluidic system have be widely employ in the field of medical diagnosis for a long time despite no requirement of external force it require strong hydrodynamic force that could potentially cause cell damage or loss during the separation process this might lead to the wrong interpretation of laboratory result since the change of structure and functional characteristic of cell due to the hydrodynamic force that occur be not take into account therefore it be important to investigate the cell viability and damage along with the separation efficacy of the device in the design process in this study two inertial separation technique spiral microchannel and contraction expansion array cea be examine to evaluate cell viability morphology and intracellular structure use a trypan blue assay tb scan electron microscopy sem and wright giemsa stain we discover that cell loss be not significantly find in a feeding system I e syringe needle and tube but mostly occur in the inertial separation device while the change of cell morphology and intracellular structure be find in the feeding system and inertial separation device furthermore percentage of cell loss be not significant in both device however the change of cell morphology be considerably increase in spiral microchannel shear stress dominate rather than in cea in contrast the disruption of intracellular structure be increase in cea extensional and shear stress dominate equally rather than spiral microchannel in these experiment leukocyte of canine be use as sample because their size be varied in a range between μm and they be commonly use as a biomarker in many clinical and medical application

415,Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Edge Feature for Image Denoising,"© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Image denoising is a classical challenge in computer vision and has attracted a large amount of research in the past few decades in attempts to find new approaches to denoise various types of images. The endeavors have been even more striking with the recent inception of deep learning. Deep learning has a well-known strength in its accuracy and effectiveness but with the main drawback of very long converging time during deep learning network training. Moreover, current state-of-the-art denoising techniques still lack the edge feature, one of the crucial attributes for sharp images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional neural network with Edge Feature (DCEF) for denoising Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). However, as the deep learning model training takes too much time to converge, we also propose an adaptive learning rate using a triangle technique that allows much faster converging time comparing to state-of-the-art approaches. Our DCEF demonstrates that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of average PSNR scores in = 15 and 25 by 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, while achieving high MS-SSIM scores and using much fewer iterations to converge.",['EE'],deep convolutional neural network with edge feature for image denoising springer nature switzerland ag image denoising be a classical challenge in computer vision and have attract a large amount of research in the past few decade in attempt to find new approach to denoise various type of image the endeavor have be even more striking with the recent inception of deep learning deep learning have a well know strength in its accuracy and effectiveness but with the main drawback of very long converging time during deep learn network training moreover current state of the art denoise technique still lack the edge feature one of the crucial attribute for sharp image therefore in this paper we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network with edge feature dcef for denoise additive white gaussian noise awgn however as the deep learning model training take too much time to converge we also propose an adaptive learning rate use a triangle technique that allow much fast converging time compare to state of the art approach our dcef demonstrate that it outperform exist state of the art approach in term of average psnr score in and by and respectively while achieve high ms ssim score and use much few iteration to converge
416,Performance assessment of a hybrid solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system with compressed air energy storage under different power demands,"© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCAs electricity demand can vary considerably and unpredictably, it is necessary to integrate energy storage with power generation systems. This study investigates a solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system integrated with a gas turbine (GT) for power generation. The advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) system is designed to enhance the system flexibility. Simulations of the proposed power system are performed to demonstrate the amount of power that can supply to the loads during normal and peak modes of operation under steady-state conditions. The pressure ratios of the GT and AA-CAES and the additional air feed are used to design the system and analyze the system performance. The results show that a small additional air feed to the GT is certainly required for the hybrid system. The GT pressure ratio of 2 provides a maximum benefit. The AA-CAES pressure ratio of 5 is recommended to spare some air in the storage and minimize storage volume. Moreover, implementation of the GT and AA-CAES into the integrated fuel cell system allows the system to cope with the variations in power demand.","['PE', 'ME', 'EE', 'CHE', 'MATH']",performance assessment of a hybrid solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system with compress air energy storage under different power demand hydrogen energy publication llcas electricity demand can vary considerably and unpredictably it be necessary to integrate energy storage with power generation system this study investigate a solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell system integrate with a gas turbine gt for power generation the advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage aa caes system be design to enhance the system flexibility simulation of the propose power system be perform to demonstrate the amount of power that can supply to the load during normal and peak mode of operation under steady state condition the pressure ratio of the gt and aa caes and the additional air feed be use to design the system and analyze the system performance the result show that a small additional air feed to the gt be certainly require for the hybrid system the gt pressure ratio of provide a maximum benefit the aa caes pressure ratio of be recommend to spare some air in the storage and minimize storage volume moreover implementation of the gt and aa caes into the integrate fuel cell system allow the system to cope with the variation in power demand

418,Vibrational Analysis on Patellofemoral Joint Degradation of Swine's Knee,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Knee's severe patellofemoral joint degeneration gives a lot of people difficulty to endure daily life because walking or any leg movement can cause serious pain. At present, physical examination, x-ray and MRI are often used to diagnose the condition; however, each of the methods has its own disadvantages. For instance, physical examination is highly dependent on the skill of the doctor who practiced the examination, which cannot avoid misdiagnosing the condition. X-ray can detect wounds and tears, but the accuracy is also not top-notch since the result of an x-ray is a 2-dimension picture. MRI is the most reliable method for diagnosing the condition; however, the cost is very high. We propose that other than x-ray and MRI, patellofemoral joint degeneration can be identified by analyzing vibrational signals obtained from an accelerometer attached to the patella while sitting and moving the leg up and down. At the beginning of the study, swine's knees are used to imitate human's knee. Swine's knees with various surface degradation levels are put on a machine that mimics the mechanism of knee motion. An accelerometer is mounted on the patella of the swine's knee while the machine is running to measure the friction and roughness induced vibration of the patella. The vibration results suggest that more surface degradation the higher vibration signal amplitude. Nevertheless, the method still needs a lot more improvement on the database and testing procedures, in order to make it accurate, dependable and affordable. Hence, with further analysis on patient's knees it is highly possible to determine whether patient's knee is degraded or not and at what degradation level.","['BME', 'MATSCI']",vibrational analysis on patellofemoral joint degradation of swine s knee publish under licence by iop publish ltd knee s severe patellofemoral joint degeneration give a lot of people difficulty to endure daily life because walk or any leg movement can cause serious pain at present physical examination x ray and mri be often use to diagnose the condition however each of the method have its own disadvantage for instance physical examination be highly dependent on the skill of the doctor who practice the examination which can not avoid misdiagnose the condition x ray can detect wound and tear but the accuracy be also not top notch since the result of an x ray be a dimension picture mri be the most reliable method for diagnose the condition however the cost be very high we propose that other than x ray and mri patellofemoral joint degeneration can be identify by analyze vibrational signal obtain from an accelerometer attach to the patella while sit and move the leg up and down at the beginning of the study swine s knee be use to imitate human s knee swine s knee with various surface degradation level be put on a machine that mimic the mechanism of knee motion an accelerometer be mount on the patella of the swine s knee while the machine be run to measure the friction and roughness induce vibration of the patella the vibration result suggest that more surface degradation the high vibration signal amplitude nevertheless the method still need a lot more improvement on the database and testing procedure in order to make it accurate dependable and affordable hence with further analysis on patient s knee it be highly possible to determine whether patient s knee be degraded or not and at what degradation level

420,Performance Comparison of Lightweight CNN Models for Drone Collision Avoidance Dataset,"© 2023 IEEE.Collision Avoidance System (CAS) is important for drone safety. CAS consists of three steps e.g., obstacle sensing, collision prediction, and collision avoidance. Collision prediction enables drones to gain information, process information, and estimate whether the object has a risk of collision. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is one of the methods that can be employed for collision prediction. However, CNN is a method that needs a large data in the training. Dario Pedro et al. provided a dataset called the CoLANet dataset that consists of VDOs of collision drones. Subsequently, they proposed a new algorithm called Neural Network Pipeline which has a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) part to extract the feature from a couple of images. CNN extracts images by using MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model. They chose MobileNetV2 due to training performance from another dataset. This paper aims to assess the performance of lightweight CNN models using the CoLANet dataset. The models will be trained on the Keras library with parameters of fewer than ten million. The models will be validated by Confusion Matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristics. In conclusion, we examine which pre-trained CNN model has the best performance and suggest ongoing work.","['EE', 'CPE', 'SAFETY']",performance comparison of lightweight cnn model for drone collision avoidance dataset ieee collision avoidance system cas be important for drone safety cas consist of three step e g obstacle sense collision prediction and collision avoidance collision prediction enable drone to gain information process information and estimate whether the object have a risk of collision convolution neural network cnn be one of the method that can be employ for collision prediction however cnn be a method that need a large datum in the training dario pedro et al provide a dataset call the colanet dataset that consist of vdo of collision drone subsequently they propose a new algorithm call neural network pipeline which have a convolution neural network cnn part to extract the feature from a couple of image cnn extract image by use mobilenetv as a pre train model they choose mobilenetv due to training performance from another dataset this paper aim to assess the performance of lightweight cnn model use the colanet dataset the model will be train on the keras library with parameter of few than ten million the model will be validate by confusion matrix and receiver operate characteristic in conclusion we examine which pre train cnn model have the good performance and suggest ongoing work

The catalyst with a Ni to Re molar ratio of 1 : 0.12 exhibited superior performance for diesel production containing large fraction of iso-alkanes in comparison to Ni and Re benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations revealed that the detection of Ni and Re co-existed with NiO and ReOx on SAPO-11 after the reduction confirmed by XRD, XANES, and XPS analysis gave a large distribution of Lewis acid sites (>80 %) noticed by Pyridine-DRIFTS measurement.

The synthetic CaCO3 samples were transformed into CaO and tested their application to high-temperature CO2 capture. Four different sorbent precursors were investigated in this work, including calcium chloride (CaCl2) and calcium acetate (CaAc2) as calcium precursor, and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2) as carbonate precursor. The results show that both calcium and carbonate precursors affect morphologies of CaCO3; CaCO3,Cl-Urea, and CaCO3,Cl-Na have calcite phase, whereas mixed-phases of calcite (30%) and vaterite (70%) are observed with CaCO3,Ac-Na, and aragonite is found with CaCO3,Ac-Urea. CaCO3,Cl-Na exhibits small cubic (rhombohedral) particle, CaCO3,Cl-Urea possesses spherical particle with rough surface, CaCO3,Ac-Na has spherical-like morphology with smooth surface, and CaCO3,Ac-Urea possesses aggregated form of CaCO3 particles. For application to CO2 capture, CaO derived from CaCO3,Ac-Urea provides the highest CaO conversion of 80% at 700 °C. The synthetic CaO-based sorbents were further incorporated with nickel oxide to form one-body bi-functional catalysts for H2 production from sorption-enhanced steam ethanol reforming. The results show that 87%H2 purity could be obtained with pre-breakthrough period of 60 min.

423,The role of ruthenium on the acidity of mixed alumina and silica phases and its impact on activity for ethanol dehydration,"© 2021 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.Ruthenium catalysts anchored on three distinct supports (γ-Al2O3, γ-χ-Al2O3, and silica [SiO2]) are tested for ethanol dehydration at 250°C. The catalytic materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy, H2 temperature programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) after reaction. The activity was correlated to the number of acid sites present in the support. However, the addition of Ru increased the activity for alumina supported catalysts. Product selectivity depends on the nature of the acid sites present on the catalytic material, with ruthenium playing a critical role on the acid properties of the catalysts.","['METAL', 'CHE']",the role of ruthenium on the acidity of mixed alumina and silica phase and its impact on activity for ethanol dehydration canadian society for chemical engineering ruthenium catalyst anchor on three distinct support γ al o γ χ al o and silica sio be test for ethanol dehydration at c the catalytic material be characterize use x ray diffraction xrd n physisorption ammonia temperature program desorption nh tpd ftir uv vis spectroscopy in situ uv vis spectroscopy h temperature program reduction experiment h tpr and thermogravimetric analysis tga after reaction the activity be correlate to the number of acid site present in the support however the addition of ru increase the activity for alumina support catalyst product selectivity depend on the nature of the acid site present on the catalytic material with ruthenium play a critical role on the acid property of the catalyst
424,Effect of small amounts of Al on the surface silanol structure and their correlation to the improved catalytic performances of WOx/SiO2–Al2O3 in the propene self-metathesis,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdSurface silanol structures, acid properties, and tungsten dispersion of the sol-gel-derived 7W/SiO2–xAl2O3 (x = 0.2–23 wt%) were investigated by means of 29Si, 27Al, and 1H MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, in-situ NH3-IR spectroscopy, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The surface silanol structure changed upon Al and tungsten loadings; however, loading of 1 wt% Al2O3 appeared to be the threshold for preserving the Si(OH)Al with isolated bridge after impregnation of 7 wt% W. The 7W/SiO2–1Al2O3 (1 wt% Al2O3) was also found to exhibit the lowest ratio of Bronsted to Lewis acid with the highest amount of Lewis acid sites and the best catalyst performances in propene self-metathesis at 550 °C in terms of both propene conversion and ethylene/butene selectivity. Despite its low tungsten dispersion, the metathesis activity was correlated well with the higher amount of tungsten carbene species, which were formed on the catalysts containing higher isolated bridge silanol and the presence of higher Lewis acid sites.","['METAL', 'CHE']",effect of small amount of al on the surface silanol structure and their correlation to the improved catalytic performance of wox sio al o in the propene self metathesis elsevi ltdsurface silanol structure acid property and tungsten dispersion of the sol gel derive w sio xal o x wt be investigate by mean of si al and h mas nmr nh tpd in situ nh ir spectroscopy xrd and raman spectroscopy the surface silanol structure change upon al and tungsten loading however load of wt al o appear to be the threshold for preserve the si oh al with isolate bridge after impregnation of wt w the w sio al o wt al o be also find to exhibit the low ratio of bronsted to lewis acid with the high amount of lewis acid site and the good catalyst performance in propene self metathesis at c in term of both propene conversion and ethylene butene selectivity despite its low tungsten dispersion the metathesis activity be correlate well with the high amount of tungsten carbene specie which be form on the catalyst contain high isolated bridge silanol and the presence of high lewis acid site

To design the cloud infrastructure to support applications in the smart city, we need a modular design model which can dynamically adjust requirements and system parameters. This paper proposes the concept of smart city cloud controller which aims to provide so-called green service resource allocation by maximizing green i.e. renewable energy usage for data centers. Based on our formulated linear programming, our proposed SCCC model can provide green service resource allocation for data centers by maximizing the green energy usage. We evaluate the SCCC formulation with the green energy usage per each data center and overall of green energy usage in optimizing green metrics. Afterward, we compare our model with a well-known algorithm for solving the resource allocation problem i.e. round-robin. The model can be applied in the smart city whose data centers have different accessibility to on-site renewable energy sources. Besides, the proposed model can adjust parameters which are design criteria for green computing; the size of tasks, different power sources; and can be used as design guidelines for green computing in smart cities with more than one power source; grid, on-site renewable energy, battery energy storage.","['PE', 'EE', 'CPE', 'IE']",cloud infrastructure design model for green smart city case study of electricity generating authority of thailand springer nature singapore pte ltd egat eco plus be a smart city initiative of electricity generating authority of thailand egat to design the cloud infrastructure to support application in the smart city we need a modular design model which can dynamically adjust requirement and system parameter this paper propose the concept of smart city cloud controller which aim to provide so call green service resource allocation by maximize green I e renewable energy usage for datum center base on our formulate linear program our propose sccc model can provide green service resource allocation for datum center by maximize the green energy usage we evaluate the sccc formulation with the green energy usage per each datum center and overall of green energy usage in optimize green metric afterward we compare our model with a well know algorithm for solve the resource allocation problem I e round robin the model can be apply in the smart city whose data center have different accessibility to on site renewable energy source besides the propose model can adjust parameter which be design criterion for green compute the size of task different power source and can be use as design guideline for green computing in smart city with more than one power source grid on site renewable energy battery energy storage
428,Probing the promotional roles of cerium in the structure and performance of Cu/SiO2 catalysts for ethanol production,"© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.In this contribution, the efficient hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to ethanol was achieved over a series of cerium promoted Cu/SiO2 (xCe-Cu/SiO2) catalysts prepared by a urea-assisted gelation approach. As a promoter, Ce played a crucial role in improving the structure, properties and catalytic performance of the Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The structure and chemical properties of the synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, in situ XRD, TEM, STEM-EDX mapping, N2O titration, H2-TPR, H2-TPD, XPS, XAES, etc. The characterization results disclosed that the addition of a Ce promoter to the Cu/SiO2 catalysts remarkably increased the Cu dispersion and retarded the sintering of small-sized Cu species. The strong interaction between the Ce promoter and Cu species substantially changed the redox properties of xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts and made the Cu2+ species easy to reduce. In addition, the activation ability of H2 species was significantly improved in the xCe-Cu/SiO2 catalysts, as evidenced by H2-TPD studies. Among these synthesized catalysts, the 1Ce-Cu/SiO2 catalyst with a 1.0 wt% Ce loading exhibited the highest catalytic activity (100% DMO conversion), ethanol selectivity (91.8%) and stability. This enhancement of catalytic activity, ethanol selectivity and stability is very promising for the development of an alternative route for the production of ethanol by hydrogenation of DMO from syngas.","['METAL', 'CHE']",probe the promotional role of cerium in the structure and performance of cu sio catalyst for ethanol production the royal society of chemistry in this contribution the efficient hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate dmo to ethanol be achieve over a series of cerium promote cu sio xce cu sio catalyst prepare by a urea assist gelation approach as a promoter ce play a crucial role in improve the structure property and catalytic performance of the cu sio catalyst the structure and chemical property of the synthesized catalyst be characterize by xrd ft ir in situ xrd tem stem edx mapping n o titration h tpr h tpd xps xaes etc the characterization result disclose that the addition of a ce promoter to the cu sio catalyst remarkably increase the cu dispersion and retard the sintering of small sized cu specie the strong interaction between the ce promoter and cu specie substantially change the redox property of xce cu sio catalyst and make the cu specie easy to reduce in addition the activation ability of h specie be significantly improve in the xce cu sio catalyst as evidence by h tpd study among these synthesize catalyst the ce cu sio catalyst with a wt ce loading exhibit the high catalytic activity dmo conversion ethanol selectivity and stability this enhancement of catalytic activity ethanol selectivity and stability be very promising for the development of an alternative route for the production of ethanol by hydrogenation of dmo from syngas
429,Development of modified airlift reactor (MALR) for improving oxygen transfer: optimize design and operation condition using ‘design of experiment’ methodology,"© 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Oxygen scarcity may significantly affect the process performance since it has low aqueous solubility and high demand by chemical and biological processes. The oxygen mass transfer is therefore necessary to enhance. This work aimed to develop the gas-liquid reactor, named Modified Airlift Reactor (MALR) for improving the oxygen transfer efficiency in terms of internal configurations and aeration parameters by equipping a vertical baffle for creating liquid circulation phenomena, and installing slanted baffles in the reactor riser to extend air-bubbles retention time and to improve their distributions. Since extremum conditions of the investigated factors may inefficient, optimum levels are required to identify. 2 k factorial and response surface design of Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology were applied to optimize these complex variables in terms of overall liquid mass transfer coefficient (K L a) of clean water. As a result, the main effective factors of MALR with their optimum value are amount of baffles (N b ∼ 3 baffles), baffle angle (α ∼ 50°), position of base area (Y r ∼ 10 cm), open space on baffle (A s ∼ 90 cm2), and gas flow (Qg). Increasing Qg resulted better K L a for the studied ranges (2–18 LPM). At the optimum condition, the improvement of MALR in terms of K L a coefficient was increased up to 97% and 28% compared to the regular bubble column and airlift reactor, respectively, at a certain gas flow without any extra energy. The correlation models of K L a coefficient with significant variables and power consumption were constructed for future estimation purposes.","['ME', 'CHE', 'EDU']",development of modify airlift reactor malr for improve oxygen transfer optimize design and operation condition use design of experiment methodology informa uk limited trading as taylor francis group oxygen scarcity may significantly affect the process performance since it have low aqueous solubility and high demand by chemical and biological process the oxygen mass transfer be therefore necessary to enhance this work aim to develop the gas liquid reactor name modify airlift reactor malr for improve the oxygen transfer efficiency in term of internal configuration and aeration parameter by equip a vertical baffle for create liquid circulation phenomena and instal slant baffle in the reactor riser to extend air bubble retention time and to improve their distribution since extremum condition of the investigate factor may inefficient optimum level be require to identify k factorial and response surface design of design of experiment doe methodology be apply to optimize these complex variable in term of overall liquid mass transfer coefficient k l a of clean water as a result the main effective factor of malr with their optimum value be amount of baffle n b baffle baffle angle α position of base area y r cm open space on baffle a s cm and gas flow qg increase qg result well k l a for the studied range lpm at the optimum condition the improvement of malr in term of k l a coefficient be increase up to and compare to the regular bubble column and airlift reactor respectively at a certain gas flow without any extra energy the correlation model of k l a coefficient with significant variable and power consumption be construct for future estimation purpose
430,Zinc-air battery dynamics' identification using transfer functions and hammerstein-wiener models,"© 2019 IEEE.This work aims to identify the dynamic behavior of a prototype tubular zinc-air battery by using a behavioral modeling approach. The class of models used to predict the behavior of the battery are as follows: linear transfer function and nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) model. Model parameter estimation was implemented in MATLAB and the response data test was categorized into three sections including single-step, multi-step and random-step responses. With respect to single-step response, both the transfer function and HW model were able to predict the response curve. As expected, the linear model exhibited lower accuracy than the nonlinear model. For multi-step and random-step responses with various step-size, the linear model cannot cope with the experimental behavior and is not able to provide accurate prediction of battery dynamics. One of the first conclusions of the study was that the nonlinear characteristic of the battery cannot be ignored, and the linear model might be inappropriate to predict the dynamic behavior of the battery. The second result was that the nonlinear model with a classic structure was able to predict the response with various step size precisely. Results implied that the HW model proved to be a versatile choice for use within a zinc-air battery system.","['METAL', 'EE', 'CPE', 'MATH']",zinc air battery dynamic identification use transfer function and hammerstein wiener model ieee this work aim to identify the dynamic behavior of a prototype tubular zinc air battery by use a behavioral modeling approach the class of model use to predict the behavior of the battery be as follow linear transfer function and nonlinear hammerstein wiener hw model model parameter estimation be implement in matlab and the response datum test be categorize into three section include single step multi step and random step response with respect to single step response both the transfer function and hw model be able to predict the response curve as expect the linear model exhibit low accuracy than the nonlinear model for multi step and random step response with various step size the linear model can not cope with the experimental behavior and be not able to provide accurate prediction of battery dynamic one of the first conclusion of the study be that the nonlinear characteristic of the battery can not be ignore and the linear model might be inappropriate to predict the dynamic behavior of the battery the second result be that the nonlinear model with a classic structure be able to predict the response with various step size precisely result imply that the hw model prove to be a versatile choice for use within a zinc air battery system
431,Effect of Drop-out Layers Inside an Long Short-Term Memory for Household Load Forecast Application,"© 2023 IEEE.Ensuring precise power load forecasting is highly important in planning the secure, steady, and cost-effective functioning of the power system. Grid planning and decision-making can be based on accurate long- and short-term power load forecasting. Recently, machine learning techniques have gained wide-spread adoption for both long- and short-term power load forecasting. Specifically, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is customized for time series data analysis. This research proposes an LSTM model for forecasting the power load of a single house containing electrical appliances over the next 20 days. We conducted a comparative analysis of the impact of dropout layers in load forecasting applications using the LSTM model. The proposed model comprises dropout rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. Their impact on load forecasting is examined. The experimental results demonstrate slight variations in predictions when altering dropout layers. The results show that the effect of dropout layers on the forecast varies the accuracy by only approximately 1%. However, the models with significant dropout rates are more general than those with lower or higher rates. So the model with a dropout rate of 0.4 is suggested.","['BME', 'IE', 'MATH']",effect of drop out layer inside an long short term memory for household load forecast application ieee ensure precise power load forecasting be highly important in plan the secure steady and cost effective functioning of the power system grid planning and decision making can be base on accurate long and short term power load forecasting recently machine learn technique have gain wide spread adoption for both long and short term power load forecast specifically the long short term memory lstm be customize for time series datum analysis this research propose an lstm model for forecast the power load of a single house contain electrical appliance over the next day we conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of dropout layer in load forecasting application use the lstm model the propose model comprise dropout rate of and respectively their impact on load forecasting be examine the experimental result demonstrate slight variation in prediction when alter dropout layer the result show that the effect of dropout layer on the forecast vary the accuracy by only approximately however the model with significant dropout rate be more general than those with low or high rate so the model with a dropout rate of be suggest

The problem is challenging due to various nonlinear temporal and difficulty for longer-step ahead prediction. The recurring congestion on rush-hour and non-recurring congestion on accidents are the main patterns. While most of the previously proposed techniques focus on rush-hour, unexpected accidents that affect local traffic were not considered in these works. To improve the prediction, we propose an ensemble deep neural network to archive the recurring and non-recurring congestion together combining CNN and LSTM architectures. Furthermore, the accident information is utilized and embedded using stacked autoencoder. An experiment was conducted on two data sets: England's Highways and Thailand's Expressways. The results showed that a combination of CNN and LSTM can be improved by using an embedded vector of accident information.","['CPE', 'SAFETY']",improve traffic prediction use accident embed on ensemble deep neural network ieee traffic prediction in a large scale network have become an important topic of an intelligent transportation system its the problem be challenge due to various nonlinear temporal and difficulty for long step ahead prediction the recur congestion on rush hour and non recur congestion on accident be the main pattern while most of the previously propose technique focus on rush hour unexpected accident that affect local traffic be not consider in these work to improve the prediction we propose an ensemble deep neural network to archive the recur and non recur congestion together combine cnn and lstm architecture furthermore the accident information be utilize and embed use stack autoencoder an experiment be conduct on two datum set england s highway and thailand s expressway the result show that a combination of cnn and lstm can be improve by use an embed vector of accident information

A series of pullout tests was carried out to analyze the bond mechanism between ETS bars and concrete for various influences such as embedment length and ETS stiffness. Together with previous data, a comprehensive analytical method for defining the ETS–concrete interfacial profile is proposed. Additionally, the proposed bond model is used to build a new method of predicting the ETS shear resisting force and assessing the absorption energy of strengthened beams. Results indicate that the developed bond model is reasonable for simulating ETS–concrete interfaces, and the method for deriving the shear contribution of ETS FRP bars through bonding-based mechanism shows good performance compared to other shear models.

The simulated results under predetermined conditions revealed that the methanol yield of 28.88%, CO2 permeation factor of 99.24% and water permeation factor of 89.64% were obtained from the MMR, which were higher than those obtained from the TMR. This was attributed to the fact that the high surface area-to-volume ratio of MMR provided superior heat and mass transfer rate for the reactions, resulting in a better performance of the reactor. Furthermore, the operating and design parameters of MMR were also investigated. It was found that the mass flow ratio of gas in biogas channels (BC) to that in reaction channels (RC) and Weight hour space velocity (WHSV) in RC significantly affected the reactor performance. Finally, the reactions of methanol synthesis in MMR were proved toovercome the equilibrium limitation at low pressure.

The positioning accuracy is computed and later compared with a controlled position where the observations are obtained by a GNSS survey receiver; Trimble R10 where the nearest Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) with baseline length of approximately 5.3 km is used as reference base stations in relative positioning computations. Their positioning results are achieved from a commercial GNSS processing software; CHC Geomatics Office (CGO) version 1.0.6. It is found that the Mi8 GNSS antenna phase centre is located on the top left of the Smartphone; approximately 2.8 cm from the centre and 0.9 cm from the top edge. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in Northings, Eastings and elevations are within centimetre level of accuracy when the screen is facing upwards. It could be concluded that a Smartphone Mi8 is capable to determine precise positions when the GNSS antenna phase centre is known and the integer phase ambiguities are correctly resolved.","['EE', 'MATH']",gns precise position determination use smartphone ieee global navigation satellite system gns raw measurement be available on smartphone run android since may this allow developer to access gnss carrier phase and pseudorange measurement therefore precise positioning could be determine some limitation be that the location of the embed gnss antenna and phase centre within the smartphone be not disclose by any manufacturer this paper aim to determine xiaomi mi s gnss antenna phase centre and its performance the positioning accuracy be compute and later compare with a control position where the observation be obtain by a gnss survey receiver trimble r where the near continuously operate reference station cor with baseline length of approximately km be use as reference base station in relative positioning computation their positioning result be achieve from a commercial gnss process software chc geomatics office cgo version it be find that the mi gnss antenna phase centre be locate on the top left of the smartphone approximately cm from the centre and cm from the top edge the root mean square error rmse in northing easting and elevation be within centimetre level of accuracy when the screen be face upwards it could be conclude that a smartphone mi be capable to determine precise position when the gnss antenna phase centre be know and the integer phase ambiguity be correctly resolve
439,Exploiting Building Blocks in Hard Problems with Modified Compact Genetic Algorithm,"© 2018 IEEE.In Evolutionary Computation, good substructures that are combined into good solutions are called building blocks. In this context, building blocks are common structure of high- quality solutions. The compact genetic algorithm is an extension of the genetic algorithm that replaces the latter's population of chromosomes with a probability distribution from which candidate solutions can be generated. This paper describes an algorithm that exploits building blocks with compact genetic algorithm in order to solve difficult optimization problems under the assumption that we have already known building blocks. The main idea is to update the probability vectors as a group of bits that represents building blocks thus avoiding the disruption of the building blocks. Comparisons of the new algorithm with a conventional compact genetic algorithm on trap-function and traveling salesman problems indicate the utility of the proposed algorithm. It is most effective when the problem instants have common structures that can be identify as building blocks.","['CE', 'CPE', 'IE', 'MATH']",exploit building block in hard problem with modified compact genetic algorithm ieee in evolutionary computation good substructure that be combine into good solution be call build block in this context building block be common structure of high quality solution the compact genetic algorithm be an extension of the genetic algorithm that replace the latter s population of chromosome with a probability distribution from which candidate solution can be generate this paper describe an algorithm that exploit build block with compact genetic algorithm in order to solve difficult optimization problem under the assumption that we have already know building block the main idea be to update the probability vector as a group of bit that represent build block thus avoid the disruption of the building block comparison of the new algorithm with a conventional compact genetic algorithm on trap function and travel salesman problem indicate the utility of the propose algorithm it be most effective when the problem instant have common structure that can be identify as build block
440,Rock wool and printed circuit boards (PCBs) as partial fine aggregate replacements in cement mortar,"© 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.The utilization of industrial wastes such as, fly ash, silica fumes, and slag in construction materials, has been receiving increased attention due to its environmental friendliness and reduction of natural resources consumptions. This study investigates and compares the utilization of spent rock wool from industrial insulation and printed circuit boards (PCBs) (the non-metallic part) as a partial replacement for conventional fine aggregates in cement mortar. Each of the waste materials was used as a partial fine aggregate ranging from 0% to 20%, by weight. The cement mortar samples were cured at 7 days, 14 days and 28 days. To investigate the properties of the cement mortars with different amounts of industrial wastes, the density, compressive strength, transverse strength and thermal conductivity of each mortar variation were measured. The results indicate that the compressive and transverse strengths of the cement mortars decreased as more industrial wastes was present in the mixtures. However, the fine aggregate substitutes improved thermal resistance, as indicated by the decreasing thermal conductivity values of the cement mortars. Thus, the use of these two industrial wastes in cement mortar could be a viable option for non-structural and non-load bearing construction applications because these substitutes have the ability to produce mortar with suitable mechanical and insulating properties.","['CE', 'ENV', 'ME', 'EE', 'MATENG', 'AGRI']",rock wool and print circuit board pcb as partial fine aggregate replacement in cement mortar trans tech publication switzerland the utilization of industrial waste such as fly ash silica fume and slag in construction material have be receive increase attention due to its environmental friendliness and reduction of natural resource consumption this study investigate and compare the utilization of spend rock wool from industrial insulation and print circuit board pcb the non metallic part as a partial replacement for conventional fine aggregate in cement mortar each of the waste material be use as a partial fine aggregate range from to by weight the cement mortar sample be cure at day day and day to investigate the property of the cement mortar with different amount of industrial waste the density compressive strength transverse strength and thermal conductivity of each mortar variation be measure the result indicate that the compressive and transverse strength of the cement mortar decrease as more industrial waste be present in the mixture however the fine aggregate substitute improve thermal resistance as indicate by the decrease thermal conductivity value of the cement mortar thus the use of these two industrial waste in cement mortar could be a viable option for non structural and non load bear construction application because these substitute have the ability to produce mortar with suitable mechanical and insulate property
441,The low temperature selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur on TiO2 supported V2O5 catalysts,"© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe selective oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur at low temperature (130 °C) was investigated on various TiO2-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The TiO2 supports were commercially available pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 21 and 43 nm with specific surface area 63 and 10 m2/g, respectively), solvothermal-synthesized pure anatase TiO2 (dXRD 15 nm, 69 m2/g), P-25 TiO2 (mixed anatase/rutile phase, 46 m2/g), and rutile TiO2 (dXRD 40 nm, 6 m2/g). In order to obtain high catalytic activity of the V2O5/TiO2 catalysts, a combination of highly dispersed vanadium oxides and a strong interaction of V-Ti species were found to be necessary. As revealed by the XPS, Raman, and O2-TPD results, the interaction between active V component and TiO2 support was shown by the presence of partially reduced V-Ti species. Due to the strong interaction between V and TiO2 support, the active V component, which was not fully oxidized, led to more oxygen vacancies being formed and facilitated a rapid catalyst regeneration from V4+ to V5+ (re-oxidation). Hence, the capability of the catalysts for H2S removal was greatly enhanced. Among them, the V2O5 supported on anatase TiO2 with dXRD 21 nm exhibited the best catalyst performances using the feed molar ratio (O2/H2S) of 0.5.","['PE', 'METAL', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",the low temperature selective oxidation of h s to elemental sulfur on tio support v o catalyst elsevi ltdthe selective oxidation of h s to elemental sulfur at low temperature c be investigate on various tio support vanadium oxide catalyst the tio support be commercially available pure anatase tio dxrd and nm with specific surface area and m g respectively solvothermal synthesized pure anatase tio dxrd nm m g p tio mixed anatase rutile phase m g and rutile tio dxrd nm m g in order to obtain high catalytic activity of the v o tio catalyst a combination of highly disperse vanadium oxide and a strong interaction of v ti specie be find to be necessary as reveal by the xps raman and o tpd result the interaction between active v component and tio support be show by the presence of partially reduce v ti specie due to the strong interaction between v and tio support the active v component which be not fully oxidize lead to more oxygen vacancy be form and facilitate a rapid catalyst regeneration from v to v re oxidation hence the capability of the catalyst for h s removal be greatly enhance among they the v o support on anatase tio with dxrd nm exhibit the good catalyst performance use the feed molar ratio o h s of
442,Experimental and Numerical Study on the Charge Decay on Solid Insulator Surface,"© 2020 IEEE.This paper presents the measurement and simulation of surface charge decay on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) circular disc. The dependency of charge reduction on varied thickness was investigated. For the experiment, a rod-plane electrode arrangement was used to generate the positive corona discharge on the dielectric surface of PMMA. The measured surface potential was used to calculate the electric field by using the finite element method (FEM). The simulation model is axisymmetric having boundary conditions based on the measured potential. The surface charge density was then calculated from the normal electric field in the PMMA side and that in the air side. The comparison of estimated results and simulation results of surface charge density was made. The surface potential distribution was initially bell-shaped then decreased with time. The mechanism of electric conduction through the volume of insulation and charge neutralization by ambient gas ions influenced the surface potential decay. In the case of thicker PMMA, the reduction of surface potential distribution was fast in comparison with other cases. The estimated surface charge density was similar to the simulation results.","['EE', 'MATENG']",experimental and numerical study on the charge decay on solid insulator surface ieee this paper present the measurement and simulation of surface charge decay on a polymethyl methacrylate pmma circular disc the dependency of charge reduction on varied thickness be investigate for the experiment a rod plane electrode arrangement be use to generate the positive corona discharge on the dielectric surface of pmma the measured surface potential be use to calculate the electric field by use the finite element method fem the simulation model be axisymmetric have boundary condition base on the measured potential the surface charge density be then calculate from the normal electric field in the pmma side and that in the air side the comparison of estimate result and simulation result of surface charge density be make the surface potential distribution be initially bell shape then decrease with time the mechanism of electric conduction through the volume of insulation and charge neutralization by ambient gas ion influence the surface potential decay in the case of thick pmma the reduction of surface potential distribution be fast in comparison with other case the estimate surface charge density be similar to the simulation result
443,Investigation of Generalized SIFs of cracks in 3D piezoelectric media under various crack-face conditions,"© 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.This paper investigates the influence of crack geometry, crack-face and loading conditions, and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap on intensity factors of planar and non-planar cracks in linear piezoelectric media. A weakly singular boundary integral equation method together with the near-front approximation is adopted to accurately determine the intensity factors. Obtained results indicate that the non-flat crack surface, the electric field, and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap play a crucial role on the behavior of intensity factors. The mode-I stress intensity factors (KI) for two representative non-planar cracks under different crack-face conditions are found significantly different and they possess both upper and lower bounds. In addition, KI for impermeable and semi-permeable non-planar cracks treated depends strongly on the electric field whereas those of impermeable, permeable, and semi-permeable penny-shaped cracks are identical and independent of the electric field. The stress/electric intensity factors predicted by permeable and energetically consistent models are, respectively, independent of and dependent on the electric field for the penny-shaped crack and the two representative non-planar cracks. Also, the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap strongly affects the intensity factors for all crack configurations considered except for KI of the semi-permeable penny-shaped crack.","['EE', 'MATH']",investigation of generalized sif of crack in d piezoelectric medium under various crack face condition high education press and springer verlag gmbh germany part of springer nature this paper investigate the influence of crack geometry crack face and loading condition and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap on intensity factor of planar and non planar crack in linear piezoelectric medium a weakly singular boundary integral equation method together with the near front approximation be adopt to accurately determine the intensity factor obtain result indicate that the non flat crack surface the electric field and the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap play a crucial role on the behavior of intensity factor the mode I stress intensity factor ki for two representative non planar crack under different crack face condition be find significantly different and they possess both upper and low bound in addition ki for impermeable and semi permeable non planar crack treat depend strongly on the electric field whereas those of impermeable permeable and semi permeable penny shape crack be identical and independent of the electric field the stress electric intensity factor predict by permeable and energetically consistent model be respectively independent of and dependent on the electric field for the penny shape crack and the two representative non planar crack also the permittivity of a medium inside the crack gap strongly affect the intensity factor for all crack configuration consider except for ki of the semi permeable penny shape crack
444,Optimal Representation for Right-to-Left Parallel Scalar Point Multiplication,"© 2017 IEEE.This paper introduces an optimal representation for a right-to-left parallel elliptic curve scalar point multiplication. The right-to-left approach is easier to parallelize than the conventional left-to-right approach. However, unlike the left-to-right approach, there is still no work considering number representations for the right-to-left parallel calculation. By simplifying the implementation by Robert, we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation. Then, for any arbitrary amount of doubling time and addition time, we propose algorithms to generate representations which minimize the time in that model. As a result, we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like NAF is almost optimal. The parallel computation time obtained from any representation cannot be better than NAF by more than 1%.",['MATH'],optimal representation for right to left parallel scalar point multiplication ieee this paper introduce an optimal representation for a right to leave parallel elliptic curve scalar point multiplication the right to leave approach be easy to parallelize than the conventional left to right approach however unlike the left to right approach there be still no work consider number representation for the right to left parallel calculation by simplify the implementation by robert we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation then for any arbitrary amount of double time and addition time we propose algorithm to generate representation which minimize the time in that model as a result we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like naf be almost optimal the parallel computation time obtain from any representation can not be well than naf by more than
445,Effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of vacuum arc melted modified nickel-based superalloys grade MGA 1400,"© Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH & Co. KG.The effect of rhenium and cobalt additions on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of modified nickel-based superalloy, grade MGA1400 by means of a vacuum arc melting method with different contents of rhenium (Re) and cobalt (Co) was investigated. After being subjected to heat treatment, the size of the gamma prime particles was slightly reduced with increasing rhenium content. Then, the alloys were exposed at a temperature of 1173 K for 1800 ks. The results showed that increasing the rhenium addition leads to a slower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. Furthermore, the shape of the gamma prime particles changed to a more cubic shape. However, an excessive rhenium content (>1.21 wt.-%) promotes the formation of a topologically close-packed phase after a 360 ks exposure at 1173 K. It can be concluded that an increase in rhenium content can result in a lower coarsening rate of the gamma prime particles. The cobalt addition is beneficial for impeding or slowing the precipitation of topologically close-packed phases at an elevated temperature.","['METAL', 'ME', 'CHE', 'MATH', 'MATSCI']",effect of rhenium and cobalt addition on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of vacuum arc melt modify nickel base superalloy grade mga carl hanser verlag gmbh co kg the effect of rhenium and cobalt addition on the microstructure and gamma prime phase stability of modify nickel base superalloy grade mga by mean of a vacuum arc melting method with different content of rhenium re and cobalt co be investigate after be subject to heat treatment the size of the gamma prime particle be slightly reduce with increase rhenium content then the alloy be expose at a temperature of k for ks the result show that increase the rhenium addition lead to a slow coarsening rate of the gamma prime particle furthermore the shape of the gamma prime particle change to a more cubic shape however an excessive rhenium content wt promote the formation of a topologically close pack phase after a ks exposure at k it can be conclude that an increase in rhenium content can result in a low coarsening rate of the gamma prime particle the cobalt addition be beneficial for impede or slow the precipitation of topologically close pack phase at an elevated temperature
446,Wheeling charge calculation with consideration of investment lifetime and power transaction locations,"© 2019 IEEE.In Thailand, Small Power Producers (SPPs), ranging from 10 to 90 MW, mostly use state-owned transmission and sub-transmission systems to transfer their electrical power to customers. This may result in an additional investment of transmission and sub-transmission systems. Consequently, the transmission and sub-transmission utilities tend to collect 'wheeling charge' from power transactions between SPPs and their customers for recovering the transmission and sub-transmission systems investment costs. The objective of this paper is to analyze the wheeling charge results by using a Power Flow Based MW-Mile method on a PEA's sub-transmission system; namely, the C1-BIC-NVC-LL-Job-10 115-kV system. Also, the paper considers the impact of the incoming SPPs locations, the additional investment during wheeling charge collecting period, and the impact of line loading of the demonstrated system. The results show that the difference in locations of power transactions can cause the difference in wheeling charge results.","['ME', 'EE']",wheel charge calculation with consideration of investment lifetime and power transaction location ieee in thailand small power producer spps range from to mw mostly use state own transmission and sub transmission system to transfer their electrical power to customer this may result in an additional investment of transmission and sub transmission system consequently the transmission and sub transmission utility tend to collect wheeling charge from power transaction between spp and their customer for recover the transmission and sub transmission system investment cost the objective of this paper be to analyze the wheeling charge result by use a power flow base mw mile method on a pea s sub transmission system namely the c bic nvc ll job kv system also the paper consider the impact of the incoming spps location the additional investment during wheel charge collect period and the impact of line loading of the demonstrate system the result show that the difference in location of power transaction can cause the difference in wheel charge result

The structural similarity of a rectangular cross-section beam with a through-thickness edge crack and elastically supported was investigated. The beam was subjected to concentrated forces perpendicular to its longitudinal axis and concentrated bending moments. Complete similarity conditions and scaling laws for static deflection and slope of the cracked beam were derived using the principle of conservation of energy and the strain energy release rate approach within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Accuracy of the derived complete similarity conditions and scaling laws were experimentally and numerically verified.

448,Effect of TMB/P123 ratios on physicochemical properties of mesocellular foam carbon (MCF-C) as catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation,"© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe preparation of mesocellular foam carbon catalysts with different ratios of 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (TMB)/P123 is represented for investigation in catalytic activity via ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. The TMB was used as a swelling agent and P123 acted as template-structuring. The physicochemical properties of synthesized catalysts were determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and carbon dioxide temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD). The evidence suggested that various ratios of TMB/P123 can differently control the mesostructure including the pore size, specific surface area, and pore volume. Particularly, MCF-C 3.5 catalyst (TMB/P123 of 3.5) enhanced the catalytic via ethanol dehydrogenation. Interestingly, effectively controllable pore structure of catalysts is beneficial for the desorption of selective product such as acetaldehyde leading to remarkably increased yield of acetaldehyde. Furthermore, the MCF-C 3.5 evidently exhibited outstanding stability at temperature of 400 °C for 12 h. Thus, it can be reasonably selected the ratio of TMB/P123 as 3.5, which is dominantly facilitated either high diffusion of reactant or high stability without losing of the traditional structure compared with other ratios of TMB/P123.","['OPTIC', 'CHE', 'MATSCI']",effect of tmb p ratio on physicochemical property of mesocellular foam carbon mcf c as catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation elsevi ltdthe preparation of mesocellular foam carbon catalyst with different ratio of trimethyl benzene tmb p be represent for investigation in catalytic activity via ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde the tmb be use as a swell agent and p act as template structure the physicochemical property of synthesized catalyst be determine use brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis transmission electron microscopy tem scan electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrare ft ir thermogravimetric analysis tga ammonia temperature program desorption nh tpd and carbon dioxide temperature program desorption co tpd the evidence suggest that various ratio of tmb p can differently control the mesostructure include the pore size specific surface area and pore volume particularly mcf c catalyst tmb p of enhance the catalytic via ethanol dehydrogenation interestingly effectively controllable pore structure of catalyst be beneficial for the desorption of selective product such as acetaldehyde lead to remarkably increase yield of acetaldehyde furthermore the mcf c evidently exhibit outstanding stability at temperature of c for h thus it can be reasonably select the ratio of tmb p as which be dominantly facilitate either high diffusion of reactant or high stability without lose of the traditional structure compare with other ratio of tmb p

Results showed that the sorbent derived from calcium D-gluconic acid (CG-AN) offered CO2 sorption capacity of 0.38 g CO2/g sorbent, which is greater than 0.17 g CO2/g sorbent of the sorbent derived from calcium nitrate (CN-AN). Addition of CTAB surfactant during synthesis was found to enhance CO2 sorption capacity for CG-AN but not for CN-AN sorbents. Stability tests of the modified sorbents for 10 cycles showed that CG-AN-CTAB provided higher CO2 sorption capacity than CN-AN-CTAB for each corresponding cycle.

453,Semantic Segmentation on Medium-Resolution Satellite Images Using Deep Convolutional Networks with Remote Sensing Derived Indices,"© 2018 IEEE.Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and remote sensing imagery. Many applications, such as urban planning, change detection, and environmental monitoring, require the accurate segmentation; hence, most segmentation tasks are performed by humans. Currently, with the growth of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), there are many works aiming to find the best network architecture fitting for this task. However, all of the studies are based on very-high resolution satellite images, and surprisingly; none of them are implemented on medium resolution satellite images. Moreover, no research has applied geoinformatics knowledge. Therefore, we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation models, which are FCN, SegNet, and GSN using medium resolution images from Landsat-8 satellite. In addition, we propose a modified SegNet model that can be used with remote sensing derived indices. The results show that the model that achieves the highest accuracy RGB bands of medium resolution aerial imagery is SegNet. The overall accuracy of the model increases when includes Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band. The results showed that our proposed method (our modified SegNet model, named RGB-IR-IDX-MSN method) outperforms all of the baselines in terms of mean F1 scores.","['EE', 'CPE', 'OPTIC', 'EDU']",semantic segmentation on medium resolution satellite image use deep convolutional network with remote sensing derive index ieee semantic segmentation be a fundamental task in computer vision and remote sense imagery many application such as urban planning change detection and environmental monitoring require the accurate segmentation hence most segmentation task be perform by human currently with the growth of deep convolutional neural network dcnn there be many work aim to find the good network architecture fit for this task however all of the study be base on very high resolution satellite image and surprisingly none of they be implement on medium resolution satellite image moreover no research have apply geoinformatic knowledge therefore we purpose to compare the semantic segmentation model which be fcn segnet and gsn use medium resolution image from landsat satellite in addition we propose a modify segnet model that can be use with remote sensing derive indice the result show that the model that achieve the high accuracy rgb band of medium resolution aerial imagery be segnet the overall accuracy of the model increase when include near infrare nir and short wave infrare swir band the result show that our propose method our modify segnet model name rgb ir idx msn method outperform all of the baseline in term of mean f score
