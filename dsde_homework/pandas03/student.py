            For the variable “Fare”, replace outlier values with the boundary values
            If value < (Q1 - 1.5IQR), replace with (Q1 - 1.5IQR)
            If value > (Q3 + 1.5IQR), replace with (Q3 + 1.5IQR)
            What is the mean of “Fare” after replacing the outliers (round 2 decimal points)?
